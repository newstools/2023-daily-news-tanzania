Young Africans striker Kennedy Musonda has received a special medal from a Spanish boy. Named Lucas Gomes, the 8-year-old boy says he was not happy to see Musonda being awarded five egg trays as man of the match award when playing for Zambian side, Power Dynamos. The medal accompanied by a letter from Gomes was presented to Musonda on Monday afternoon by Spain Ambassador to Tanzania at his residence in Dar es Salaam. In his acknowledgement, the Zambian striker says it is a hamble gesture for him and that when the egg issue happened, it went viral across Africa saying sometimes, he was receiving negative comments. “I thank God that something amazing has come out of the bad story,” he says. He then read the contents of the letter which says: “Hello Kennedy, I am Lucas Gomes, am sending you this letter because I have seen that Xavi received a trophy and you have been given five trays of eggs. “It seems unfair to me and made me very sad, that is why I want to send you this medal because you also deserve recognition. Regards, Lucas, I play hockey in Madrid.” Musonda then promised to keep the medal next to that of Yanga he is going to win this season. Also present at the brief occasion was Yanga president Hersi Said.
