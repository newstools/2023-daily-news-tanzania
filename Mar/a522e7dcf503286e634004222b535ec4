At least 32 people have been killed and dozens injured after a head-on collision between two trains in Greece. The crash took place outside the central city of Larissa which took place late on Tuesday when a passenger train heading from Athens to the northern city of Thessaloniki collided with a cargo train travelling from Thessaloniki. Some of the passenger carriages exploded in flames from the impact.  “We heard a big bang, (it was) 10 nightmarish seconds,” said Stergios Minenis, a 28-year-old passenger who jumped to safety from the wreckage. “We were turning over in the wagon until we fell on our sides…then there was panic, cables (everywhere) fire, the fire was immediate, as we were turning over we were being burned, fire was right and left.” Thessaly regional governor Konstantinos Agorastos told SKAI TV that the first four carriages of the passenger train were derailed in the crash, with the first two carriages, which caught fire, “almost completely destroyed”.
