Singida Big Stars have leapfrogged Azam on third place of the Premier League table after a 1-1 draw against Coastal Union. The two teams have shared spoils at Mkwakwani Stadium in Tanga on Sunday afternoon. The hosting side opened the scoreboard in the 44th minute through Greyson Gwalala to keep his side upfront. However, in the 73rd minute, substitute Bright Adjei leveled the deficit for the visitors. As it stands, Singida Big Stars have 48 points on the log from 25 matches while Azam are fourth with 47 points. However, the Chamazi based giants could regain the third slot if they manage to win against Ihefu on Monday. The two sides play at Highland Estates Stadium in Mbarali, Mbeya.
