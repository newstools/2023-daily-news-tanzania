THE Commission for Human Rights and Good Governance (CHRGG) has challenged women to continue believing in themselves and use technology in advancing their own development. Speaking during the International Women’s Day Celebration held in Kondoa District, Dodoma Region on Wednesday, the (CHRGG) Chairman Judge (Rtd) Mathew Mwaimu said that if technology is appropriately used it will become the catalyst of women development and the nation as a whole. “We join the community and various stakeholders in the world to recognise the contribution of women in various development fields and we ask the community to continue reflecting on the importance and the way technology can be a catalyst to bring about gender equality as well as economic development for women,” he said. Mwaimu also asked the government and various stakeholders to prepare a special programme that will help women, especially in rural areas, to use technology in economic self-sufficiency and for sustainable development. “We ask the government to focus on this, we have the opportunity also to discuss and prepare effective strategies that will help use technology to solve the challenges faced by women and other special needs groups to eradicate violence and bring about gender equality,” he said. Mwaimu also called upon the society to continue using technology professionally and to adhere to the laws, human rights and the principles of good governance in order to protect the society from technology’s negative effects, especially gender based violence and moral decay. On her part, the Dodoma Regional Commissioner (RC), Ms Rosemary Senyamule urged the community to consider the girls’ rights by protecting them from early marriage so that they can fulfill and achieve their dreams and goals in life. “We need to protect girl children, provide them with social services and education that will help and enable them to claim their rights as well as protect themselves against gender based violence,” she said. RC Senyamule also challenged women to come forward and take advantage of the various opportunities provided by the government in order to achieve gender equality goals and sustainable development.
