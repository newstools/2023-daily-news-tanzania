KCMC Hospital has signed an agreement with the Spanish football giants, Real Madrid Foundation that plans to construct a sports field for patients with albinism. The agreement was signed on Wednesday at KCMC hospital in Moshi where the Real Madrid Foundation will help to build and construct sports grounds that will host varieties of sports disciplines special for patients with albinism. KCMC Hospital’s Public Relation Officer Gabriel Chisseo told ‘Daily News’ on Wednesday that the initial agreement between the two parties has been signed and some of KCMC representatives will fly to Madrid in October to sign a memorandum of understanding that will pave the way for the project implementation. “We have already signed the initial agreement and some of our representatives will fly to Madrid this October where they will sign a Memorandum of Understanding in which the whole implementation of the programme rests,” he explained. Adding, he said the target group of the project is patients with albinism, but the project upon its completion will benefit the whole country’s sports fraternity. “People with albinism are their main target and they want them to participate in various sports and the playing grounds will have floodlights to enable them to play at night. They can’t take part in sports during the day so the only way to engage them is during the night,” he explained. He further said the Real Madrid Foundation has already given them playing kits such as balls and pairs of jerseys and later they will provide more when the project gets underway. On his part Real Madrid Foundation Manager for Middle East and Africa Inigo Arenillas-Chavez Vallejo thanked KCMC Hospital counterpart for reaching an agreement. “We are looking for more agreement with our KCMC fellows in October where they will fly to Madrid to sign the MoU,” he said.
