AS Tanzania joined the rest of the world to mark the World Kidney Day on Thursday, the day reminds Hamed Said, a resident of Manyoni, Singida, of a kidney transplant operation performed on his young brother Mohammed Sultan at the Benjamin Mkapa Hospital (BMH). Last December, Mohammed Sultan underwent the lifesaving operation after he was diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) last August and commenced dialysis at the 400-bed capacity hospital. Speaking to the ‘Daily News’ at the BMH on Wednesday, Mr Said decided to come back to express his appreciation to management and staff members for their hospitality since the first day his brother was diagnosed with CKD at the Central Zone Referral Hospital. “We’ve become a family because the hospital received well my brother and started dialysis last August before he underwent kidney transplant last December,” he said. This year’s World Kidney Day goes under the theme ‘Kidney Health for All-Preparing for the Unexpected, supporting the vulnerable!’ BMH became the second health facility in the country to introduce kidney transplant service in 2019, but it remains the only hospital to perform the lifesaving operation by using its very own medics. According to the hospital’s Executive Director, Dr Alphonce Chandika, BMH introduced kidney transplant service under the auspices of Japan based Tokushukai Medical Group before local medics three years ago.
