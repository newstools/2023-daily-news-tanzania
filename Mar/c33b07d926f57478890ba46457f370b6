THE first Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) exhibition prepared by LPG EXPO Company from Singapore, Tanzania LPG Association (TZLPGA) with collaboration with the government of Tanzania, will take place next week in Dar es Salaam. Speaking to the media on Thursday in Dar es Salaam, the Director of LPG EXPO, Catherine Ho, said that the exhibition will take place from March 15th and 16th in Dar es Salaam. She said that the exhibition will be the first to be staged by their company in the East African region and particularly in Tanzania. “More than 50 exhibitors from outside Tanzania, including China, India, Thailand, Europe and other countries will participate in the exhibition. Our company is active in West Africa but in East Africa, it is our first time to have such exhibition in Tanzania,” said Catherine. According to her, the exhibition will offer a crucial opportunity for Tanzanian LPG suppliers and dealers to learn new technologies of LPG. She said their aim is to move Tanzania to the correct direction on the usage of LPG, which is useful for environmental protection by discouraging the use of charcoal and firewood. The Executive Director of TZLPGA, Amos Jackson, said that there is great demand for LPG in Tanzania, with data showing that in 2021 about 136,000 tonnes of LPG, equivalent to 136 million kilos per year were consumed in Tanzania. Jackson observed that there is an increase in demand of LPG in the country of between 10-15 per cent per year. Due to its importance, he called upon all domestic LPG suppliers and dealers to actively participate in the exhibition so that they can improve their businesses. “There are 200 big suppliers and 5,000 dealers of LPG in Tanzania, we encourage them to participate in the exhibition which will sharpen their knowledge on LPG business,” said Jackson.
