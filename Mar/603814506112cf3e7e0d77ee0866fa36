Ugandan side Vipers have parted company with coach Beto Bianchi following poor performance in the CAF Champions League. His sacking comes barely two days after suffering a 1-0 setback from Simba at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam on Tuesday. The Brazilian trainer has endured a bumpy ride in the group stage of the competition after failing to register a win in four fixtures played. “Vipers Sports Club announces that the contract of head Coach Beto Bianchi has been terminated with immediate effect. “The club would like to thank Bianchi for his tireless efforts during his time at the club and wish him success in his future endeavours. We remain; One Team One Dream…,” reads the Viper’s statement. His heaviest defeat was a 5-0 from Raja Casablanca in their inaugural match of group C played in Morocco. Thereafter, he succeeded to pocket one point from Horoya following a goalless draw and this is so far his best results in the group stage mission. Moreover, he went on to stamp two consecutive 1-0 defeats from Simba in a double-header clash played in Uganda and Tanzania respectively. With two games to go before the wrap up of the group stage campaign, Vipers remain glued at the base of their group with one point in the bag. Hence, their chances of sailing into the quarterfinals have practically faded away. However, in the Uganda Premier League, they sit in fourth place with 28 points from 15 matches after generating 8 wins, 4 draws and 3 defeats
