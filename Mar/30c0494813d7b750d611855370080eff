The contract saga between Young Africans against their player Feisal Salum refuses to cease. This comes after the Legal and Players Status Committee of the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) which sat on Thursday afternoon for the review of the case declined to rescind its first decision that Feisal is a legal Yanga player. According to the statement released by the federation, it says the committee has found no legal reasons to reverse the first verdict and that much details will be made available on Monday, March 6th. Meanwhile, Yanga insist that Feisal breached some contract agreement in his quest to terminate it saying his current contract run up to 2024. Of late, there has been a tag-of-war between Feisal and his club whereby the former is allegedly forcing his way out of the club while the latter claims he has a valid contract until 2024. The Jangwani street based side claim that some key procedures were not properly followed by the player in his effort to terminate the contract. However, Feisalâ€™s last match to play for Yanga before the eruption of the saga was a 3-0 win against Coastal Union at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium on December 20th.
