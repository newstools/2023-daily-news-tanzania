CALL has been made urging religious leaders to step up efforts in fighting against increasing moral decay in the society, especially among the youth. The call was made over the weekend in Dar es Salaam during the prayers for the nation by hundreds of Christian women from different denominations. The gathering for prayers was organised by the Tanzania Mennonite Church in collaboration with The Tanzania Episcopal Conference (TEC), the Christian Council of Tanzania (CCT), Norwegian Church Aid (NCA) and others. “The issue of moral decay is serious, as the nation we should take action. We, religious leaders, must not accept it, we must educate our people to refrain from immoral acts,” the Tanzania Mennonite Church Bishop Nelson Kisare stated. Bishop Kisare said there has been several challenges in the country that needed prayers from believers, pointing out that killings and gender-based violence are among them. “Let the Almighty God give us strength and spirit that will change us positively in addressing these issues so that as a nation we can move forward,” he said. On her part, NCA Country Director Berte Marie Ulveseter underscored the importance and strength of prayers in the country. Ms Ulveseter noted that the NCA joins various countries in ensuring that there is gender equity, including ensuring women get equal opportunities in holding leadership positions. Ahead of the International Women’s Day, she said: “Equity means creating an inclusive and a just world.” NCA works with faith actors and religious leaders as they play major roles in their societies in promoting justice and reducing poverty, inequalities and discrimination. She said faith actors and religious leaders are potentially crucial actors who stand up for women’s rights and promote gender justice. According to her, NCA supports the partners and other civil society actors in changing social gender norms by upholding equal rights and condoning gender-based violence.
