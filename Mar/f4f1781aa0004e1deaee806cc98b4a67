EXIM Bank has celebrated the International Women’s Day with the introduction of its new women-based product ‘Supa Woman’ account aimed at drawing the services closer to those at grassroots. Exim’s Head of Branch Network, Agnes Kaganda, said the accountholder stands a chance to take 90 per cent of her deposits as loan at an affordable rate. “The account also comes with a free life insurance service and loan payments, and depends with the customer choice of when to start repay the loan. “The creation of the account came after listening to our client’s views—both male and female,” Ms Kaganda said on Wednesday. The bank used the International Women’s Day cerebration to introduce the Supa Woman account since the occasion was best suited. The Exim women day held in Dar es Salaam carried the slogan ‘Unaweza Yote’ (You Can Do It) The bank, one of the top ten big lenders in the country, said this year’s International Women’s Day themed “DigitALL: Innovation and Technology for Gender Equality” resembled Supa Woman account’s DNA which is purely digital with the aim of removing obstacles and the hassles that obstruct women from taking part in the banking services. Exim’s Head of Products and Revenue Assurance, Mtenya Cheya said the account was taking advantage of various business opportunities and the increase in commercial interaction among women in the East African Community and other neighbouring countries.
