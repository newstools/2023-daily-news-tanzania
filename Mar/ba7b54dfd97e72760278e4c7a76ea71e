THE Small Industries Development Organisation (SIDO) has called on fashion and clothing designers to invest much in intelligence and technology in designing excellent products for local and foreign markets. The Manager of SIDO in Geita region, Nina Nchimbi made the recommendations recently during the official launch of the fashion platform named Golden Fashion Festival in Geita. She said, SIDO mission and vision is to see youths attain not only the self-employment but also live their dreams, achieve their goals and help other people through arts and creativity. “Our motto is innovation and technological change, so we congratulate the coordinator and we assure full support for the Golden Fashion Festival. “Through fashion industries, we can design and produce various products, but above all, we can create jobs for many youths in the value chain.” The coordinator of the Golden Fashion Festival, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Kasikana Collection, Bertha Komba said the festival brings together 20 clothing designers. She explained 15 fashionists are Geita residents and five others are from neighbouring regions. They all joined the launch of the Golden Fashion Festival held in Geita town. Bertha said the mission of launching the Golden Fashion Festival in Geita is to provide an opportunity for emerging fashion designers and clothing designers to showcase their products. “I have decided to use this opportunity to motivate my colleagues in the fashion and design industry. I believe that through this festival we shall expand the scope of marketing.” She said the Golden Fashion Festival opens the doors to a big fashion and clothing art festival that will be held in December 2023 in Geita town. The Secretary of the Tanzania Women’s Chamber of Commerce (TWCC) in Geita Region, Evelyn Bwire explained that the festival is an opportunity for youths to promote and expand the value chain.
