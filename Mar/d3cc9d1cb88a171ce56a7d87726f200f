CHINA is set to resume its pilot outbound group travel to Tanzania from mid this month, after it put to ice the process following the COVID-19 outbreak. Beijing suspended overseas group tours in January 2020 amid the spread of deadly pandemic while permitting Kenya, one of the East African countries for overseas group tours trial phase in February 6, this year. The Chinese Ambassador to Tanzania @ChenMingjian_CN posted on Twitter on Thursday saying “more Chinese tourists will visit Tanzania.”

According to information published by China Briefing website, the Chinese travel agencies opened their outbound group travel for Chinese citizens to 20 other countries before Tanzania since February 6, 2023. The website mentioned the countries as Thailand, Indonesia, Cambodia, Maldives, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore and Laos. Other countries are the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Kenya, South Africa, Russia, Switzerland, Hungary, New Zealand, Fiji, Cuba, and Argentina. However, the decision is based on factors related to COVID-19 control measures and socioeconomic growth, and it was taken at the request of the foreign affairs panel of the State Council’s Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism – the country’s major COVID-19 management task force.
