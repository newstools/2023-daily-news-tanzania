President Samia Suluhu Hassan says she dislikes making reshuffles frequently but she is been forced to do so due to unavoidable circumstances. The Head of State made the remarks in Arusha on Thursday when she was officiating a retreat of Ministers, deputy ministers, permanent secretaries and their deputies. She told the officials who attended the three-day event held in the northern part of the country that she has made changes purposely to spare the government from unnecessary troubles. “I’m aware of the consequences of changing leaders frequently, and, I don’t like doing that because it makes officials to work with fear…leaders don’t come up with long term plans fearing that their appointments may be revoked. “It also brings disappointments to the families and those who considered them (revoked ones) as their role models,” she says. She added; “It is not my aim to change leaders frequently because it takes a long time to nurture them… I’m optimistic that this retreat will shade light on leadership skills, efficiency and productivity.” Early this week, President Samia urged top public officials to avoid conflicts because they detail development. Briefing on the well-attended event, Chief Secretary Dr Moses Kusiluka mentioned five topics which will feature in the retreat. The topics are:- · Operating procedures, relations and operational boundaries in the government · The procedure for making policy decisions in the government · Human resource management · The relationship between the government and private sector · Various guidelines for working in the government President Samia will take part in some topics to share her experiences.
