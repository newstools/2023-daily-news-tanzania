LINDI Regional Administrative Secretary (RAS) Mr Ngusa Samike has directed contractors implementing rural road projects in Kilwa District Lindi Region to complete the projects in time and ensure value for money. Mr Samike made the call recently when he visited the District to inspect the work progress on Road projects being implemented by Tanzania Rural Road Agency (TARURA) in the financial year 2023. He vowed that the government would take action including blacklisting all the contractors who fail to meet performance expectations as per contract. “I hereby sound a warning to contractors who fail to meet work expectations that we are yet to come up with a commitment to blacklist all the contractors that fail to complete the work as required,” he said. On the other hand, the RAS directed the management of TARURA in the District to strictly monitor and oversee the contractor undertaking work on a 12 km Mingumbi -Chapita in the Kilwa District. He said the 390m/- worth project which is being implemented by Malcom Investment Company Limited is taking too long to be completed a move that slows down the movement of people from one place to another. Meanwhile, TARURA District Manager for Kilwa Engineer Agatha Mtwangambate said the government has set aside 918m/- from roads Fund to repair the roads in the District. He said TARURA has already signed 12 contracts with contractors to repair some roads and construct new roads and bridges. He said three of the contractors have already accomplished their work. He said Kilwa District has a total of 1,076.10 kilometres road network.
