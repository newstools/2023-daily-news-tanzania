SIMBA Assistant Coach Juma Mgunda said they will approach their Azam Sports Federation Cup (ASFC) last 16 match against African Sports seriously in the quest for a victory. The two teams meet on Thursday (tomorrow) in Dar es Salaam battling for a quarterfinal ticket. Speaking on Tuesday, Mgunda said preparations for the important game are going on well and their priority is to win and cruise into the last eight. “We are doing our usual training sessions like the way we do before facing any team because there is no simple game in football…as such, all precautions to face African Sports are being considered. “For them to reach this far, they were not voted but rather worked hard on the pitch as such, the match is going to be difficult, but we are hopeful to triumph,” Mgunda said. African Sports are currently in the  9th place in the Championship League with 21 points from 9 matches after winning five games, drawing 6, and losing 8 encounters. For Simba to reach this far, they eliminated  Coastal Union with a 1-0  win while their opponents African Sports defeated New Dundee 4-2 on post-match penalties after playing to a goalless draw. However, in other ASFC last 16 games, Geita Gold host Green Warriors at Nyankumbu Stadium in Geita on Friday. On Saturday, three matches will be played when Ihefu will welcome Pan African at Highland Estates Stadium in Mbarali, Mbeya, Mtibwa Sugar will take on KMC in an all-Premier League meeting at Manungu Complex in Morogoro while Singida Big Stars will go head to head with JKT Tanzania at Liti Stadium in Singida. On Sunday, two venues will explode when  Azam take on Mapinduzi at Azam Complex in the city while Kagera Sugar will host Mbeya City at Kaitaba Stadium in Kagera for another all-Premier League clash. Yanga are defending the title as they try to keep it for the second time in a row.
