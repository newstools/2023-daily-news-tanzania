PAMBA Assistant Coach, Godfrey Chappa applauded his charges with a hard earned 2-1 victory over Transit Camp FC in their Championship League match at Uhuru stadium over the weekend. Speaking after the game, Chappa congratulated his players for the victory. “I congratulate my players; they have perfectly followed the technical bench’s instructions. We have now won two consecutive matches in away venues, something which is not easy at all,” he said. He said the team now prepares for the Saturday Championship League match against the Mtwara- based Ndanda FC at Nangwanda Sijaona in Mtwara. He said the league has been very difficult as every team is well organised in seeking victories as most of them are separated by a small margin in the standings. He called upon football fans in Mwanza to continue supporting their team in their home and away matches. He promised to continue working closely with the entire technical bench, officials, players and fans so that they achieve their goal of this season and that is to earn Premier League promotion after a twenty-year absence. On his side Pamba FC winger Herbert Lukindo said they are still determined to earn Premier League promotion. Pamba are placed 3rd with 41 points after their 20-match outings. The team has won thirteen, drawn two, and lost five matches. They have netted 25 and conceded 16 goals. After their weekend match against Ndanda, Pamba will travel to Dar-es-salaam to face Green Warriors FC at Major General Isamuhyo Stadium on March 26th this year. Pamba will play Kitayosce at Nyamagana Stadium in Mwanza on April 1st and on April 15th , they will play Kitayosce at the same venue.
