The second biggest crocodile habitat in Africa has dried up completely following failed rainy seasons. Lake Kamnarok in Kenyaâ€™s Rift Valley was once home to 10,000 crocodiles, second to Lake Chad in holding capacity. But the ox-bow lake has been shrinking over the years, largely due to fluctuations in weather systems. It has also been draining its water to a nearby river through a natural fissure, according to local reports. #BBC
