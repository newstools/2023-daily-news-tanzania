A CALL has been made to Tanzanians, especially workers whose occupations confine them to sedentary deskbound duties for prolonged periods time to establish personal fitness regimes in order to invigorate their health and keep infectious diseases at bay. The reminder was made by the DCB Commercial bank Internal Audit Manager, Samwel Mahendela, who was giving his advice at the backdrop of this year’s edition of Kilimanjaro Marathon which took place in Moshi, Kilimanjaro. Mahendela, who captained a contingent of 40 DCB Commercial Bank workers who features in the international athletic event in the town, said the marathon was helpful for workers in the banking sector, who expend much of their working time to serve customers while seated. “ Participating in this race, combined with routine physical exercises rejuvenate the physical and mental well-being and enhance efficiency at the workplace, most of time we find that we execute most of our duties in sedentary mode and lack enough time to exercise,” he said. The DCB official commended the bank for enabling its workers participate in the classic event by supporting the DCB Runners Club. “I advise workers in the banking sector and Tanzanians at large to exploit the keep-fit opportunity offered by Kilimanjaro Marathon to invigorate their health, said Mahendela.
