Various financial services provided by the National Bank of Commerce (NBC) specifically for women prominently featured and attracted many participants, who took part at the 2nd Edition of The African Business Women and Youth Trade Fair and Summit 2023 that is ongoing in Arusha Region. Making the revelation at the five-day meeting and exhibition, the bank’s Business Development Manager, Arusha branch, Mr Prince Moshi said that their participation was encouraged by the various services the financial institution has been providing specific for women entrepreneurs. “We had planned well to use this opportunity to promote our specific services for women and entrepreneurs in our products of Kua Nasi and Johari Accounts,”’ he said. “To clarify, the Kua Nasi account is a special account for small businesses such as food vendors, retail store owners, food and produce processors, bodaboda riders and similar groups, while the Johari account is specifically for women to make it possible for them to save little by little with as low as only 10,000/-. All these two accounts do not have monthly deductions,” He noted that conference was organized by the Tanzania Women Empowerment Network (TAWEN) in collaboration with the East African Business Council (EABC) with the aim of promoting the participation of women and youth in business, noting: “In addition to promoting the bank’s services at the exhibition, we have also planned to equip women with business skills, offer them mentoring, and expose them to networks. “That is why NBC has been at the forefront to ensure that we continue to increase the skills of women entrepreneurs and to improve their ideas and products in order to build their capacities so that they become business professionals and make profit that will enable them to repay their loans,” he said.
