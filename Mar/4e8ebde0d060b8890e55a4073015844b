IT is an all- Premier League quarterfinal of the Azam Sports Federation Cup (ASFC) as the football family eagerly awaits the best of eight fixtures. Azam were the last side to join the class of best eight teams following their 2-0 victory over Mapinduzi at Azam Complex in Dar es Salaam over the weekend. Goals from Cyprian Kachwele and Nathan Chilambo were enough to send them further in the competition thereby rekindling their hopes of winning one of the three major silverwares at the end of the season. The campaign has witnessed 20 goals netted in various venues across the country as Simba and Young Africans emerge the heavy winners in the process. The Msimbazi Street Reds who became the first side to book a quarterfinals ticket defeated African Sport 4-0 at Uhuru Stadium in the city which was a sweet day for them after declaring they want to win to regain the title they lost last season. Similarly, reigning champions, Yanga handed Tanzania Prisons a 4-1 blitz at Azam Complex, hence keeping alive their dream of defending the trophy for the second time in a row. However, victories recorded by Simba and Yanga come as an indicator of possible meeting between them in a traditional derby match somewhere in the competition. Another side which stamped a big win was Geita Gold who beat Green Warriors 3-1 at Nyankumbu Stadium in Geita as they too showcased massive performance aiming at lifting the title. On the other hand, Ihefu and Azam cherished 2-0 victories apiece against Pan African and Mapinduzi respectively. Narrow wins were produced by Singida Big Stars (1-0) against JKT Tanzania, Mbeya City (1-0) versus Kagera Sugar and Mtibwa Sugar (1-0) over KMC. The full list of ASFC quarterfinalists is made up of Simba, Yanga, Azam, Mtibwa Suga, Mbeya City, Geita Gold, Ihefu and Singida Big Stars.
