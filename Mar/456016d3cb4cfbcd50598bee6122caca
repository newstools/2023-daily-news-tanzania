Azam FC have missed out a chance to regain third place on the Premier League table after suffering a 1-0 defeat from Ihefu at Highland Estates Stadium in Mbarali, Mbeya on Monday afternoon. Skipper Raphael Daudi has headed home in the 38th minute from Never Tigere set-piece which was enough for the hosts to seize maximum points from the home soil. The victory has placed Ihefu on 6th slot on the log with 33 points and are just one point away from catching up Geita Gold who sit on the fifth place after pocketing 34 points. For Azam, they stay put on the fourth place with 47 points, one point adrift Singida Big Stars who have accumulated 48 points from 25 encounters making the third place battle really interesting. Ihefu have since managed to deny victories at their turf to two big teams Young Africans and Azam as they await to host Simba on April 8th. Before engaging Azam, they defeated Dodoma Jiji 2-1 at Jamhuri Stadium in Dodoma to pocket massive points from away turf. The Mbarali based clubâ€™s last Premier League match to lose was a 1-0 upset against Young Africans at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam on January 16th.
