PRESIDENT Samia Suluhu Hassan has revoked the ownership of farm number 934 in Kiembeni sub street, Mapinga Ward in Bagamoyo District, Coast Region, which has a total area of 374 acres. Dr Samia has returned the ownership of the farm that was once the property of AZANIA Investment Limited to the government. The company is engulfed in a conflict with residents of the area who had invaded the farm while AZANIA was still recognized as the rightful owner, until last weekend when the president reached the decision to change its ownership. Coast Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr Abubakari Kunenge said in his ongoing tour to solve land conflicts in Mapinga Ward on Monday that following the president’s decision, all residents who are still in the farm are invaders and are required to vacate. “After receiving these directives from the president, anyone who is still doing any activity in the farm is an invader.  What we are waiting for is more directives from the president.  And, if she decides that the area has to be used for settlement, then it will be put under District Council supervision and planning,” he said. RC Kunenge spent time to emphasize to Mapinga residents that the government will not hesitate to take stern action towards individuals who are proved to possess land against the law. Bagamoyo District Commissioner, Ms Halima Okash who accompanied the RC during the tour urged the residents to stop selling their land without following proper procedures and urged all individuals who are buying land to do the same to avoid conflicts. One of the elders in Mapinga area, Bole Shindika thanked the government for the decision and urged other residents to respect it while waiting for further directives, which he said will be for their own good. Mapinga Ward in Bagamoyo District is one of the areas with large number of land conflicts in the country which had forced the government to form a special committee to investigate the situation and come up with solutions.
