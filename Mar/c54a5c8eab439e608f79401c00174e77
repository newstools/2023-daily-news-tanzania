It is reported that more than 60 bodies have been recovered in Malawi’s main commercial hub of Blantyre after Tropical Storm Freddy hit southern Africa for the second time in a month. BBC reports strong winds and rains continue to cause severe destruction. “We have rivers overflowing, we have people being carried away by running waters, we have buildings collapsing,” BBC quoted police spokesman Peter Kalaya. It’s is said the SADC member state was “overwhelmed.” Relentless rain and strong winds have hampered overstretched emergency teams in the country’s southern and central regions, which are worst affected, Mr Kalaya said.
