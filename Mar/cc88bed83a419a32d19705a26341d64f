THE 25th Premier League round wraps up with a tricky fixture as rejuvenated Ihefu welcome Azam at Highland Estates Stadium in Mbarali, Mbeya today. It is one of the tense matches of the elapsing round bearing in mind that Ihefu have had a recent good run and have gone six matches in all competitions without suffering defeat. They seem to have found the lost key which has unlocked their prosperity door hence positive results are following them and in today’s match, they look better positioned to use well home ground advantage. Their previous game was a 2-0 success over Pan African in Azam Sports Federation Cup (ASFC) at their backyard which guaranteed them space to the quarterfinals. While in the league, they defeated Dodoma Jiji 2-1 at Jamhuri Stadium in Dodoma to pocket massive points from away turf and are now among the feared teams to meet in the league. Ihefu’s last premier league match to lose was a 1-0 upset against Young Africans at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam on January 16th. Since then, they have engaged in five league fixtures, winning three and stamping two draws in the process which is a good trend for them. For Azam, they are fully aware that any setback will see them drifting away from the third place finish of the campaign as they face real competition from Singida Big Stars. In their two league assignments, they have generated four points courtesy of a 1-1 draw versus Simba and a 1-0 triumph over KMC played at their Azam Complex in the city. However, despite losing ground in battling for the season’s league silverware, Azam still have a chance to add a new trophy in their cupboard only if they manage to clinch the ASFC honour.
