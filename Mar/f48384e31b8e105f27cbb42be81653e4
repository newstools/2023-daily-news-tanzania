US Ambassador to Tanzania, Michael Battle has hailed President Samia and opposition Chama Cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo (CHADEMA) Freeman Mbowe for choosing reconciliation over division. The diplomat said this on Thursday through his verified Twitter account, @USAmbTanzania as he congratulated the two sides for modeling what political competition without animosity. “Hongera sana [congratulations] to President @SuluhuSamia and @freemanmbowetz for choosing reconciliation over division and modeling what political competition without animosity can look like,” Ambassador Battle tweeted as he tags President Samia and Freeman Mbowe. On Wednesday, President Samia Suluhu Hassan engraved her name in the history books by being the first leader to attend an opposition party’s event since the ushering in of the multiparty system. It has been President Samia’s clear intention of realising her self-crafted 4Rs philosophy (Reconciliation, Resilience, Reform and Rebuild), which she has repeatedly touted as impressive pillars for multiparty democracy as well as for economic prosperity. And, for the second time in a month’s time, President Samia hinted on the possible constitutional reforms for the betterment of the country’s political landscape. According to the US Envoy, President Samia’s attendance as a Guest of Honor at the Chadema’s Women Wing (BAWACHA) International Women’s Day gathering in Kilimanjaro is a lesson to be learned by others. “We can all take a lesson from what transpired yesterday [Wednesday]. A big day for democracy in Tanzania,” he said.
