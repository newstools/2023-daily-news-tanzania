Young Africans have sealed a quarte-final slot of Azam Sports Federation Cup (ASFC) after a 4-1 triumph over a 10-man Tanzania Prisons. The tense game at Azam Complex in Dar es Salaam on Friday evening has witnessed five goals being scored in the second half as the hosting side march on to the next phase. Skipper Bakari Mwamnyeto break the deadlock in 51st minute after being left unmarked inside the opponent’s box. But, spirited Tanzania Prisons flattened the curve in the 61st minute, thanks to  Jumanne Elifadhili’s header. At 1-1, the game reached its peak but substitute Clement Mzize put back his side upfront with a 70th minute strike. In 80th minute, Stephanie Aziz Ki increased the tally via a spot-kick before Mzize completed his brace on the day in 88th minute to make it 4-1. However, an opportunity for him to seal a hat-trick was paralysed after his 90th minute penalty went over the crossbar to the relief of the visitors. As the final whistle blows, Yanga cherished the outcome while Tanzania Prisons have found it hard to digest the heavy defeat.
