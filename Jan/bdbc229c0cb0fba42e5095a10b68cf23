COAST Region authorities are working out strategies to improve academic performance in its primary and secondary schools. According to Coast Regional Commissioner, Mr Abubakar Kunenge, improved supervision involving communities and improving teaching and learning environment will help to attain the intended goal. The RC made the remarks during a task force meeting for education personnel in the region held at Kibaha Education Centre (KEC) grounds recently, drawing more than 900 participants from across the region. The meeting was organised jointly by the Regional Commissioner’s office and the Ministry of State, President’s Office Regional Administration and Local Government (RALG). “We conducted this conference as per the directives issued by Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa last year,” said the RC, noting that the meeting sought to identify and address challenges facing the sector as well as devise ways to improve academic performance. He added that the region also conducted a survey across its councils to get students’ views on the same. “Through the findings, we have learnt that there are still a large number of parents who are not willing to see their children, especially girls, pass their examinations and continue with secondary education,” he said. He said the findings have helped the region to embark on educating communities on the importance of girls’ education and the fight against child marriages. During the 2021 Standard Seven National Examinations results, Coast Region posted 84.9 per cent pass rate and in 2022, the region’s pass rate slightly dropped to 83.2 per cent.
