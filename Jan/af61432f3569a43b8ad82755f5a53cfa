Only 11% of Tunisian voters turned out for the second round of parliamentary elections in what is being seen as a clear rejection of the controversial reforms of President Kais Saied. Opposition parties boycotted the poll, accusing the president of staging a coup after he shut down parliament in 2021 and gave himself almost unlimited executive powers. He also introduced a new constitution at the same time. Turnout was similarly low in the first round of voting. Tunisia is experiencing a deep economic crisis that has caused severe shortages of many basic foods.
