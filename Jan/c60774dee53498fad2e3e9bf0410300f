INTERNATIONAL Centre for Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) have joined forces with the Tanzania Agricultural Research Institute (TARI) to control crop pests in Geita region. Speaking on the project recently in Bukombe District in Geita region, the Research Officer from TARI-Ukiriguru, Dr Abdulla Mkinga, said using alternative biological technology the mission is to promote active farming. He said, the alternative biotechnology will involve the use of live insects, which are friendly to crops namely-parasitoids, predators and pathogens to attack fall army-worms and caterpillars in the field. He said the full programme is run under the supervision of the Tanzania Plant Health and Pesticides Authority (TPHPA). “The aim is to raise the effectiveness in controlling crop pests in a safe way by reducing the use of chemical pesticides and insecticides which are harmful to the environment and human health. “This alternative technology will facilitate the availability of crop yields that meet international market criteria,” Mr Mkinga noted. Commenting, a representative officer from ICIPE organisation, Ms Rechel Owino said the suggested biological technology is between 65 and 70 per cent effective. “The technique destroys caterpillar eggs, army-worms and reduces the cost of using industrial chemicals,” he said. He added that apart from the biological control, they encourage the use of Pull Push control, which involves cultivating maize and legumes or weeds in the field to control pests. The Bukombe District Agriculture Officer, Mr Joseph Machibya admitted that using the alternative way, they hope to raise maize production from current 2.3 tonnes to above. An officer from the TPHPA, Biological Plant Pest Control Unit in Kibaha, Ms Zuwena Msuya noted that the most dangerous caterpillar to control originated from South America and entered the country in 2016.
