THE race for the golden boot in the 2022/23 Premier League season has turned into a two-horse showdown; Young Africans against Simba affair that puts four players at the front of the pack. Yanga’s striker Fiston Mayele is at the frontline of the mission with 15 goals against Simba’s trio; Moses Phiri with 10 goals, John Bocco and Saidi Ntibazonkiza with nine goals apiece. From obscurity, the Burundian import r has joined the race as his goal-scoring instincts have not faded away and from his two consecutive league matches, he has already contributed five goals. He seems to have found his scoring boots which perfectly fit him well and together with Bocco, they are just one goal away from catching up with the team’s current top goal scorer, Phiri. The Zambian hitman is still recovering from an injury keeping him out of action though he is slowly beginning to conduct light training. At his former club Geita Gold, Ntibazonkiza excelled to score four goals meaning that despite being superb in providing assists, he can too score when necessary and this is exactly what he is doing. However, Yanga’s top marksman Mayele, when he looks over his shoulders, he sees a trail of other top  scorers coming closer to him hence compelling him not to lose ground. Last term, he narrowly missed out on an opportunity to win the golden boot prize as he saw it going to the former Geita Gold striker George Mpole who enjoyed a great term. Mpole did the Tanzanians proud on the day by clinching the top scorer’s award beating those from other countries and this season, it is a puzzle if the domestic striker will pocket it once again. In terms of individual teams with many goals after 20 played matches, Simba have seized command with 50 goals followed by Yanga with 38 goals while Azam have netted 36 goals.
