The Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF) has until business end of today to disburse to the Arusha District Council’s office 103.5m/- for construction of a walkway bridge for Engosengiu residents at Sinoni Ward in Arusha. This follows a directive by Minister of State in the President’s Office (Public Service Management and Good Governance), Ms Jenista Mhagama, after she visited the populous area on Friday. The Minister who was irked by the delay in the completion of project, two years on, directed officers from the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) to zero in on the nitty-gritties of the stalled project and take stern measures where appropriate. “I want this to be a transparent exercise and I’ll be back towards the end of March to inspect the completed project before handing it to the residents,” vowed the Minister. Ms Mhagama saw how the residents hustled to cross the deep ravine to get access to social services such as health and education. “I’ve seen it for myself and I don’t think these residents deserve this nightmare,” she said amidst a thunderous applause from Engosengiu residents who gathered for a public rally at Sinoni Ward offices. The area ward councillor Michael Kivuyo narrated to Ms Mhagama the ordeals that the residents encountered in crossing the ravine. “We had to walk 10 kilometers to access health services when hospitals and schools are just a stone throw away,” he said. Earlier on, Arusha urban Member of Parliament Mrisho Gambo faulted TASAF officers for delaying the project, much to the misery of Engosengiu residents. The lawmaker informed the Minister that the project failed to kick off even when sufficient funds had been initially been put in place. According to the legislator, some 74mn/- had been allocated for the purpose, before the Minister’s directive.
