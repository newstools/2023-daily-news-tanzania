While cases of violence against women and children are on increase, police in Kagera Region are investigating an incident where a husband allegedly killed his wife and later dumped her body in a pit latrine. Kagera Regional Police Commander Assistant Commissioner (ACP) William Mwampaghale named the suspect as Simon Samson (30), a resident of Missenyi District’s Kakindo Village. He explained that initial investigations revealed that on New Year, the couple went to a local pub where they drank several rounds of beer to celebrate. Later, they went back home but a quarrel erupted. “For yet unknown reasons the suspect (Samson), assaulted his wife identified as Merriness Jonathan (34), killing her in the process. He later dumped her body in a pit latrine. The body was recovered four days later,” he said. He explained that the suspect had already been arrested and he would be arraigned in court when the investigations are completed.
