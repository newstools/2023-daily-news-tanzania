The newly paraded Simba Head Coach Roberto Oliviera has vowed to create a strong team capable to win CAF Champions League title. The Brazilian made the remarks on Tuesday afternoon in Dar es Salaam at a press briefing shortly after being introduced as the Reds trainer. “I am happy to be here and my target is to create a strong team which can win the champions league trophy,” he says. Also, the Brazilian coach has revealed that he likes ‘attacking’ football and that he is going to install his new tactics in the team right away. Before joining Simba, Oliviera was coaching Vipers FC of Uganda who are among the best football clubs on the continent. He is therefore set to work alongside two Assistant Coaches Juma Mgunda and Selemani Matola who are currently in Zanzibar with the squad for the 2023 Mapinduzi Cup contest. In the Premier League, Simba are sitting in second place with 44 points from 19 matches, 6 points adrift leaders Young Africans who have maximised 50-points from the same number of games.
