HAVING been granted accreditation for its laboratory last year, the Dodoma-based Benjamin Mkapa Hospital (BMH) is now seeking institutional accreditation on quality in healthcare. BMH Head of Quality Assurance, Dr Bushi Lugoba, said here on Monday that the BMH was now providing its staff members with training in 5S Kaizen, a Japanese business philosophy. “Training in 5S Kaizen is meant to enhance quality services through reorganisation services in order to attain international standards,” said Dr Lugoba while briefing this reporter on the just ended training workshop on 5S Kaizen. The training workshop organised by the Hospital’s Quality Assurance and Clinical Audit Unit brought together 20 participants from different departments. They were trained on the basic concept of 5s as well as 5S tools. He explained that the 5S Kaizen is a tool that was developed originally in the Japanese manufacturing sector to organise the workplace and that 5S stands for abbreviation of Japanese terms with initial S. Mr Paschal Mashauri, one of the participants, said the training would help enhance healthcare services at one of the country’s major hospitals. For her side, another participant Ms Willieth William expressed gratitude to the management for the training, which she said would improve service delivery at BMH.
