THE race for Premier League’s maximum points continues with four teams engaged in the battle of supremacy in two venues today. At Uhuru Stadium in Dar es Salaam,  KMC host Namungo while at Nyankumbu School’s arena in Geita, Geita Gold entertain Coastal Union with all four teams looking seriously to bag vital points as the season surges towards the end. A win with a bigger margin will enable KMC to leapfrog Namungo out of the sixth place in the standings, hence making a big step forward in the race for the top-four finish. Namungo are keen to win today to reach 29 points and keep climbing up the ladders bearing in mind that any drop of points will be detrimental to them. They need to recover from the 2-0 loss they suffered to Polisi Tanzania at Majaliwa Stadium in Lindi in their last league encounter and they seem to have acquired enough resources to stamp success after the match. “We are aware that in our past game, the outcome was disappointing and this is another moment for us to write a new chapter by winning this game,” said Namungo’s Assistant Coach Shadrack Nsajigwa. Likewise, at Nyankumbu Stadium in Geita, Geita Gold have another test to pass as they welcome Coastal Union in an exciting match set to attract the attention of many people. Their previous assignment against Polisi Tanzania ended in a 1-1 draw with the latter equalising it in the dying minutes to salvage a point from the away territory.
