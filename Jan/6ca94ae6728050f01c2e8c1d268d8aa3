Senegal’s President Macky Sall has said a second road accident this month involving mass casualties has underlined the need for better road safety measures. On Monday morning, 19 people were killed when a bus and another vehicle collided in the north of the country. Last week, the president declared three days of mourning after a crash involving two buses left 40 people dead. The government also banned buses form travelling at night and ended the practice of importing second-hand tyres. This morning, Mr Sall sent his condolences to the families of those who died in the latest incident.
