KAGERA Regional Commissioner, Albert Chalamila has tasked the contractor undertaking the construction of a 120-kilometre Bugene-Kasulo road to work around the clock in order to complete the work before the deadline. Equally, he urged wananchi where such projects are being implemented to ensure that they safeguard the infrastructure and avoid vandalism. The RC made the remarks on Wednesday where, among other things, he inspected several road projects, including the 120 kms Bugene- Kasulo (Benaco) road which is being built at the cost of 109bn/-. He explained that the Bugene- Kasulo (Benaco) road is of great importance because it will link Tanzania to four neighbouring East African nations, namely Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda and South Sudan. “The Bugene (Karagwe) – Kasulo (Benaco-Ngara) road is of great importance because it will enhance the regional economy, allowing citizens of the five EAC countries to conduct business. “People should safeguard and avoid vandalising the project through theft of building materials and fuel,” he said. He also instructed the contractor to ensure that he provides essential social services in villages surrounding the project including health facilities and improving schools’ infrastructures. Engineer Christian Mbise under Tanroads Engineering Consulting Unit (TECU), informed the RC that the 120-kilometre Bugene- Kasulo (Benaco) road was being undertaken by a contractor, Ms China Road and Bridge Corporation Company Ltd (CRBCC), and was expected to be completed within a 30-month period. He further elaborated that the work progress to-date had reached 6.7 per cent while the contractor was making efforts to hire qualified engineers and other essential equipment on the project site.
