AZAM have completed the signing of Ghanian goalkeeper Abdulai Iddrisu as they strengthen the team’s goalkeeping section to make it more secure. He was officially introduced on Sunday via the team’s official Instagram page as he posed together with the club’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Abdulkarim Amin ‘Popat’. He becomes the first foreign import to land at the Chamazi-based giants during the ongoing mini-transfer window. His arrival gives a wide selection option for the team’s technical bench as they already have in stock Ali Ahamada who was critised by pundits in their 3-2 loss to Young Africans saying he conceded silly goals. Ahamada has recently been under heavy scrutiny a development which has forced the management to bring on board his challenger to battle for the number one spot. Moreover, despite Azam accommodating the third place on teams with more goals, they have conceded 20 goals from their 19 outings practically meaning that their defensive department is still porous. In the league, Azam are placed on third place with 40 points from 19 games and are among the teams which are on the right track silently chasing for the premier league title. They trail the current leaders Young Africans with 10 points a trend which will make them come back stronger when the league resumes in order to bridge the existing gap. In one of his past interviews, Azam’s caretaker coach Kali Ongala admitted that it would be impossible to challenge for the championship claiming that the 10-point gap is too much for them to bridge. From 19 matches, the Chamazi-based giants have stamped 12 wins, 4 draws and 3 losses and are among the best performing teams in the league.
