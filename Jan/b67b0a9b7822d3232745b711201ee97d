AFTER stamping a third Premier League win of the campaign, Polisi Tanzania have now focused on their next game  against Geita Gold whom they meet in the 21st round on January 20th this year. The Moshi-based side were on rampage over the weekend as they beat Namungo 2-0 at Majaliwa Stadium in Lindi to gather maximum points from an away turf. Democratic Republic of Congo import striker Enock Mayala netted  a brace on his debut league match for the Tanzanian side which is a good reception for him. “We are proud with this victory because it has helped us to get winning confidence and we hope to continue with this performance in our upcoming matches. “Also, we cherish our new player Mayala for his brilliant form he has shown on his first premier league appearance. Scoring two goals has uplifted him individually and it is our belief that he will keep on pushing forward,” said Polisi Tanzania Assistant Coach John Tamba. His counterpart for Namungo, Denis Kitambi seized responsibility for the loss saying mistakes which his charges conceded were positively capitalised by their opponents. “I am responsible for the loss, we gave them much freedom to dominate us but this is football, we have to look up for other incoming league assignments in order to recover from this damage,” he said. With the slump, Namungo have now garnered 26 points from 20 matches as the splint towards the end of the season intensifies with ten games to go before the campaign concludes. The league continues today with two games as leaders Young Africans welcome Ihefu at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam. The other encounter sees Azam interfacing Tanzania Prisons at Azam Complex in the city for yet an explosive duel.
