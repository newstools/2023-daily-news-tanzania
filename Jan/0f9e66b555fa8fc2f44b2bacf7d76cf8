TANZANIAN Coffee traders eying the Chinese market must register with the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) in Tanzania, Ambassador of Tanzania in China, Mbelwa Kairuki said on Monday. The envoy said the earlier GACC portal used to register traders in China has been suspended. He said some local traders have so far started registering at the ministry calling on more traders to submit their application at the ministry. Some companies that have already been registered include Kilimanjaro Cables (T) Limited, Cotacof Limited, Taylor Winch Tanzania Limited, Dorman (Tanzania) Ltd, Kamal Agro Limited, Redloong Investment Company Limited and Ibero Coffee Trading Company (T) Limited. Tanzania plans to increase its coffee export to China and plans are getting underway for Tanzanian businessmen to take part in the China-Africa Economic and Trade Expo scheduled for June 2023 in Hunan.
