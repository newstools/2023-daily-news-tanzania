Tomorrow, six arenas expect to explode with the big match unfolding at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam where Simba host Coastal Union in a game likely to be action-packed.

In Dodoma, New Dundee will be hosting African Sports at Jamhuri Stadium  while in Geita, Geita Gold welcome Nzega United at Nyankumbu Stadium. Then at Majimaji Stadium in Songea, Mbeya Kwanza go head to head against Mbeya City in a seemingly highly competitive match as the two sides know each other well, having met in the Premier League before the former was  relegated. On Sunday, four encounters will be staged to seal the round of 32 fixtures. In Dar es Salaam holders Young Africans will play Rhino Rangers at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium. At Majaliwa Stadium in Lindi, Namungo will host Ihefu as Kagera Sugar will lock horns with Kengold at Kaitaba Stadium in Kagera whereas Mashujaa play Tanzania Prisons at Uhuru Stadium in Dar es Salaam.
