Nyoni made the revelation during the Kabaddi Bonanza organised by the Buffalo team and involved teams from various schools and colleges based in Dar es Salaam. The organiser’s Buffalo team welcomed teams from the St Joseph University of Tanzania, High Mountain View Secondary School, and Mlangeni Primary and Secondary schools. Speaking with the Daily News’, Nyoni noted they have plans to scout players who will impact the game in the next two years Insisting these players have a chance to become more competent and build a solid national team to proudly represent the country in the global level events “Due to efforts done by the association in developing the sport to the talented young players, we hope they will be more competent in the next two years and develop a solid national team.
