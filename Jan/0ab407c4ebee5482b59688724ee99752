BOLT Tanzania has commended the Land Transport Regulatory Authority (LATRA) for issuing new guidelines for the ride-hailing industry in the country. Speaking on that Bolt Regional Manager, Eastern Africa Mr Kenneth Micah said “We would like to appreciate Latra and the relevant authorities that have worked tirelessly to ensure that the concerns raised by the industry stakeholders were addressed, to ensure a win-win situation for all stakeholders.” The remarks from Bolt come after Latra had issued a gazette notice number 7284, of 30th December last year on the new tariff guidelines for the ride-hailing industry. In light of Latra’s new regulations for the ride-hailing industry players, Bolt is going to make the necessary changes to its commission and passenger fare pricing structure as per the tariff guidelines in the coming days. Latra and other key stakeholders in the industry have had a series of engagements, following the issuance of Latra’s order no 01/2022, in March last year where Latra sought to cap the commission at 15 per cent. Bolt had agreed to temporarily comply with the directive to demonstrate goodwill despite the negative impact the capping had on the business. This was done to create an opportunity for an amicable resolution, with the overall objective of developing the nascent ride-hailing sector in Tanzania. Bolt will continue to offer full-scale operations to ensure that hundreds of thousands of users in mainland Tanzania will continue to access affordable, safe and convenient means of moving around the city. Bolt is committed to ensuring that the thousands of drivers driving on the bolt platform in Tanzania will continue to access earning opportunities. Bolt is also committed to further collaborating with Latra and other relevant industry stakeholders, to ensure the growth of a free and favourable market for ride-hailing services in Tanzania.
