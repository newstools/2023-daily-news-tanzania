THE Generation Equality Forum (GEF) has met with the National Identification Authority (NIDA) to discuss ways of fast-tracking access to national identity cards for women and girls. GEF delegation included nine members of the National Advisory Committee from Tanzania Mainland and Zanzibar led by its chairperson, Ms Angellah Kairuki, Minister in the President’s Office (Regional Administration and Local Government), and other five executives from the NIDA . The meeting was held at the Bank of Tanzania (BOT) in Dar Es Salaam recently where GEF chairperson, Ms Kairuki said national ID is a prerequisite for women empowerment and economic rights. “NIDA is one of the major key areas in achieving gender equality in economic justice and rights since national identification cards are needed in various economic issues including property rights such as land acquisition and management,” Ms Kairuki said. She noted however that women and girls have not been adequately reached to understand its importance. GEF is a five-year programme intending to attain economic justice by 2026 as part of the country’s global commitments to Economic Justice and Rights. On his part, NIDA’s Acting Director of IDs Management, Mr Edison Guyai, said to ensure that the country’s commitments are attained, the authority planned to register all the people who are required to be registered according to the law. He stated that the National ID system is an essential part for the planning of human development, therefore. “We are also planning to review the registration and identification of Person Act (CAP 36 R.E 2012), which does not mandate registration and identification to be compulsory for all citizens,” he explained. The two parties therefore agreed to continue working together in raising awareness to women for easing access to the national identity cards.
