Young Africans have sealed a 1.5bn/- sponsorship deal with Haier Group Corporation specifically for CAF Confederation Cup (CAF CC) mission. Speaking during the occasion held in Dar es Salaam on Monday night, Yanga’s President Hersi Said says the deal is only valid throughout their confederation cup assignments. “As you know, we qualified for the group stage of CAF CC hence the coming in of Haier is going to help us a lot to be economically stable,” says Engineer Hersi. He adds: “According to restrictions imposed by CAF whereby betting companies are not allowed to sponsor teams at this stage of the competition, our Jerseys will have Haier logo other than SportPesa. “SportPesa will continue to be our main sponsors in Premier League and other contests which do not have restrictions on betting firms and the good thing is that they (SportPesa) have understood us.” Also, the Young Africans have introduced new special Jerseys to be worn throughout the CAF CC matches whose price is pegged at 50,000/- per piece. According to Hersi, the new kits will begin to be sold today and will only be found at the club’s headquarters located at Jangwani Street in Kariakoo, Dar es Salaam.
