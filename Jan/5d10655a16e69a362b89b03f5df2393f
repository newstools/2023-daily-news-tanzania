Health experts have exuded confidence on the Universal Health Insurance (UHI) Bill 2022 saying it will enable Tanzania have access to quality health services. Speaking here midweek, the Executive Director of the Kibong’oto Infectious Diseases Hospital (KIDH), Dr Leonard Subi said once it becomes a law, it would see Tanzanians enjoying access to the full range of quality health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship. “This is a laudable move by the government and it goes to show that the government prioritises the health of its citizens for development,” observed Dr Subi. According to the health expert, the importance of access to health services and information as a basic human right is universal. Mawenzi Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) Medical Officer in Charge Dr Edna-Joy Munisi, said she was confident that once approved, UHI will be a massive life saviour as far as the provision of quality health service is concerned. “The otherwise high cost of premiums and the misconception that subscribing to health insurance funds on a voluntary basis locked out many Tanzanians from accessing quality health care,” Dr Munisi opined. Nonetheless, (UHI) Bill, which was to be discussed in parliament and complete all three stages of reading, in November last year has been postponed until consultation between the Parliament and the government is completed. National Assembly Speaker Tulia Ackson announced in the Parliament last year that the bill would be returned to the Social Services and Community Development Committee for further consultations.
