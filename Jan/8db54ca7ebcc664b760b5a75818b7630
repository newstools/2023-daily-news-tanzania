TANZANIA Prisons have parted ways with Kenyan coach Patrick Odhiambo following series of dismal performance in the Premier League. The sacking came after Tanzania Prisons suffered 2-1 to Ihefu at Sokoine Stadium in Mbeya over the weekend. The team’s management made the decision to rescue the team from relegation threat. Meanwhile, Tanzania Prisons remain upbeat to shrug off winless demon despite succumbing to a third consecutive loss. They suffered a 2-1 loss to Ihefu at Sokoine Stadium in Mbeya over the weekend making it a third back to back loss by them, dropping nine points in the process. It was a 10th nosedive for Tanzania Prisons in the unfolding campaign and so far, they have conceded 30 goals in their 21 matches. However, in his remarks, the team’s Assistant Coach Shaban Mtupa admitted that they have recorded unconvincing outcome in three encounters but he insisted that they have enough time for the wound to recover. “Yes, it is not a perfect run for us but this is football, you win and you lose. The most important thing for us is to keep our heads up and making sure that we succeed in our next match. “Every game is difficult and no coach would be happy to see his side failing to win matches, we are going back to the training ground and address all the emerged shortfalls,” he said. On his part, Ihefu trainer Zuberi Katwila could not hide his excitement for picking maximum points on the day though he conceded that it was a difficult puzzle to solve. “Playing against Tanzania Prisons at their home is never easy because they play with more energy and we were prepared for that… luckily, the product at the end of the game has gone our way,” said Katwila. It was a good recovery from the Mbarali based outfits who prior to that were defeated 1-0 by Young Africans at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam.
