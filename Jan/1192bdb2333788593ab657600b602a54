Members of Public Service Social Security Fund (PSSSF) have been reminded to update their records and develop a tendency of regularly tracking their membership contributions to avoid unnecessary inconveniences during payment of pension. “We keep on reminding our members that it is important to have their records updated. Sometimes inconveniences include delays in payment because of lack of proper information,” said Ms Amina Kassim, PSSSF Manager for Zanzibar office. She was speaking at the ongoing Mapinduzi International Trade Fair at Maisara grounds, emphasizing that it was important for every PSSSF member to have his or her information right and also keep on tracking contributions right from the day of employment. “PSSSF members should not wait until time for pension payment,” she said at the Trade Fair held recently as part of the activities ahead of commemorating the 59th anniversary of the Revolution tomorrow. She added: “We have improved communication and we are close to our members since we have opened an office in Zanzibar so that it is easier for PSSSF members to get services.” She also asked employers to accord full cooperation to PSSSF officials when they approach them to collect information on their employees to minimize inconveniences during retirement. Ms Kasim reminded the general public that PSSSF members are all employees in the public service employed after the commencement of the PSSSF Act. Mr Juma Hassan, one of the stakeholders said he was happy with the opening of PSSSF office in Zanzibar, noting that the big advantage of having such offices in Zanzibar would be to address inconvenience to members like travelling to Dar es Salaam to seek services.
