DODOMA-BASED Benjamin Mkapa Hospital (BMH) has introduced a health TV show, ‘Maisha na BMH’ to raise awareness and boost people’s wellbeing. Hospital’s Head of Communication and Public Relations Unit, Mr Jeremiah Mbwambo, noted here yesterday that the weekly TV programme will be hosting a guest, who is a leader and one specialist doctor from the BMH. “The aim is to improve the well-being of the people across the country. As the public hospital, we have a role to raise awareness in public health and the TV programme will focus on raising awareness on health issues,” he said. Mr Mbwambo said that the topics would be changing based on surveys carried out by the Communication and Public Relations Unit of the BMH, saying ‘wananchi’ would be able to suggest topics. “We came up with the idea of a health TV programme due to the need in public on health education,” he said. Mr Mbwambo said first Maisha na BMH would host the Police Force Spokesperson, Davis Misime and a neurosurgeon, Dr Henry Humba, from the BMH, saying the first topic will be road accidents and effects. “The neurosurgeon will explain the best way to offer first aid to people who experience injuries in road accidents such as fractures in order to curb people becoming disabled,” said Mr Mbwambo.
