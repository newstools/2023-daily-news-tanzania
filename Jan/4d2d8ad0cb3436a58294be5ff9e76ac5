MORE than 100 Police Officers in Dar es Salaam conducted a cleanup campaign in Temeke District on Friday with the aim of strengthening relations between the Police Force and members of the public. The initiative was in response to the directive from Inspector General of Police (IGP) Camilius Wambura, that they participate in social activities so as to strengthen relations with the public. Speaking at the event, Superintendent of the Police Force, Damas Mpepo, said the exercise would be regular, adding: “We are doing it with the aim of building good relations with the community and build good image of the police among members of the public.” He further said the volunteering cops included those from the Police Band, who started by cleaning the Stereo Market in the vicinity, because the situation at the place was not impressive, adding that the market serves many citizens and even foreign nationals. On his part, the Councillor of Temeke Ward, Omary Makwama, congratulated the Force for its decision which would create a good image to the community. He asked them to continue with such charity activities in other areas, promising to cooperate with the police in implementing such initiative. Elaborating, Makwama said hygiene is crosscutting issue and everyone should engage. Similary, Temeke District Marketing Officer Anzamweni Mandari said: “This market serves many people who come as vendors and traders on a daily basis…approximately it serves 4500 to 4600 people who engage in various business activities. So it is a sensitive area which we must ensure is clean to avoid outbreak of water-borne diseases like cholera.”
