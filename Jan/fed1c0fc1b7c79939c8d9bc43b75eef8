SOME 25,000 residents from five villages in Mbuluma Ward in Kalambo District, Rukwa Region can now show a sign of relief after 1.7bn/- water dam was being constructed for them. In his speech to the media, Kalambo District Rural and Urban Water Supply Authority (Ruwasa) Engineer Francis Mapunda said: “We thank the sixth phase government under President Dr Samia Suluhu Hassan for the spirit to help us. The project is funded by the National Water Fund (NWF) to the tune of 1.7bn/-, whose construction is scheduled for accomplishment in June, 2023.” He noted that upon completion, the project will supply clean water to at least 25,000 residents in the five villages at Mbuluma Ward. “The infrastructure will help them engage in other development activities, instead of spending much of their time in search for precious water,” he added. “Chelesi General Enterprises has been contracted to undertake the project, which will be executed into two phases. The first phase will involve the execution of water infrastructures,” he noted. On her part, Kalambo District Commissioner Ms Tank Mwela asked the villagers to ‘own’ and protect the water infrastructures and refrain from vandalising them, so that they can stay for many years for their benefits, saying: “Millions of taxpayers’ money has been spent on this project.”
