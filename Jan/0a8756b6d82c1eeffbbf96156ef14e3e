THE Tanzania Fertilizer Control Authority (TFRA) has warned farmers who beneficiaries of subsidized fertilizer are against sell the product because doing so means violating the guidelines governing the distribution of the fertilizers. TFRA Acting Manager for Lake Zone, Mr Khanafi Mohamed issued sounded the warning recently in an interview with journalists in Geita Town Council. He said TFRA has identified some farmers who benefited from subsidized fertilizers but instead of using in their farms, they it to traders who are not registered into a TFRA system. “We keep conducting regular inspection to identify them. We have arrested some who violated the order in Magu and Sengerema districts in Mwanza region. The subsidized fertilizers are meant to help farmers so that they can boost production and not selling them to traders,” he insisted. He explained that the government’s intention to allocate 150bn/-   as fertilizer subsidy was to help farmers increase productivity especially in food and commercial crops. Mr Khanafi further said that TFRA has also discovered that the number of farmers who register with TFRA system for approval of subsidized fertilizers is very low. Mr Khanafi explained that, for Geita Region, TFRA aimed to register 156,000 farmers but to date only 60,000 farmers have been registered, equivalent to 38 per cent of the target. Geita Region Agriculture Officer, Mr Tito Mlewa said until January 2023, the region had received 184 tonnes of fertilizers from the Cereals Products Board (CPB). He explained that, 32 tonnes have been sent to Nyang’hwale District Council, 60 tonnes to Bukombe District Council, 42 tonnes to Geita DC and 50 tonnes to Geita Town council.
