PRIME Minister Kassim Majaliwa has instructed heads of department in all local government councils to properly supervise implementation of development projects being implemented in their respective areas for the sake of ensuring value for money in all activities. He said the government under President Samia Suluhu Hassan has been dishing out a lot of money for the implementation of development projects aimed at easing accessibility of social services to the public across the country. The money being issued, according to him, must tally in terms of value for money with work that is being done accordingly. Premier Majaliwa issued the instructions on Friday in Namtumbo District, Ruvuma Region when inspecting the construction of the Namtumbo District Hospital. His visit was a follow-up of various directives he issued on October 18, last year, including removal of 10 substandard doors. His instructions were to be implemented before January 4 this year. Following his directives a total 67 of substandard doors out of 84 were removed. Some 15 out of 54 new doors were fixed in the new buildings. Mr Majaliwa expressed satisfaction with the progress on the implementation of his directives, maintaining a stand on the government’s determination to provide quality social services to the public in the country. So far, a total of 4.2bn/- has been issued by the central government for the construction of 20 buildings in Namtumbo District of which 13 have been completed. Five of them are in the final stages of completion and the remaining two structures are in various construction processes. “President Dr Samia is so determined to ensure provision for quality social services to all Tanzanians, that is why she has been releasing enough funds for the implementation of these projects,” he said.
