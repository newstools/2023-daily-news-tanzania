THE government has provided over 13bn/- to Lindi District to facilitate the implementation of Water projects in the area. Area District Commissioner Shaibu Ndemanga made the revelation here noting that the money has been used to execute eleven water projects as others are underway. Ndemanga made the revelation here when officiating the Semi-annual meeting convened by Community Based Water Supply and Management Organisations (CBOs) in the district. He said the money was provided under President Dr Samia Suluhu Hassan to help improve public water supply in the district. Acting District Manager for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (RUWASA), Mr Atanasi Patrick, said 76 per cent of the population in Lindi have access to water services. Meanwhile the DC urged CBOs in the area to ensure better management of water projects, income and expenditure to avoid unnecessary chaos that may occur between the organisations and water users in the community. In addition, the DC asked the CBOs to provide good cooperation to village executive officers especially in the provision of management reports. He said those managing the CBOs have bad habits of despising village executive officers, a move which instigates poor understanding towards good cooperation. He said the leaders of CBOs should ensure the money collected through their projects are managed well and saved in bank accounts instead at their homes. “You (CBOs) should collect and save the money in banks to avoid unnecessary chaos in the community,” he said reiterating that the CBOs should make public the reports on revenue and expenditure generated by the CBOs.
