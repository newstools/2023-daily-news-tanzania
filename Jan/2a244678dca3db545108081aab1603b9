THE government is pushing herders and herdsmen to effectively use state-built dips to help control external parasites attacking cattle’s as a result of ongoing climate change. Deputy Minister of State Vice President’s Office Union and Environment, Khamis Hamza Chilo said cattle dipping will help kill ticks and other tick-borne diseases leaving the cattle’s and the herders safe. The simple procedures, he said, can be done by any farmer in their respective communities and will protect the livestock from the roaming parasites. “All livestock keepers must ‘sanitize’ their cattles to prevent them from such diseases,” Mr Chilo told residents of Machenje village in Dodoma on Thursday. He warned over reckless acts of cutting trees among the general public highlighting the grave impact it has had on both the human and livestock population. “The areas are desert and it’s because people are cutting down a lot of trees. We must plant a considerable number of trees to also ensure sustainability of these livestock,” he said.
