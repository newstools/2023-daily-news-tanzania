THE Director General of the Medical Store Department (MSD), Mavere Tukai, has said the production of gloves at the Idofi factory in Makambako Town Council is expected to start in July this year. He said the construction of the factory would be important in enabling MSD to meet 83.4 per cent of the demand for gloves in the country. Mr Tukai pointed out this during the visit by Njombe Regional Protection and Security Committee to the factory at the weekend, noting that the delay would be worked on soon. In his address, he further said that the factory construction would cost 16.7bn/-, despite now registering 70 per cent in erection. On her part, the MSDâ€™s Board of Trustees Chairperson, Rosemary Silaa said the factory will provide more than 200 permanent jobs for Tanzanians and at the same time save the country from spending 24 billion per year to buy the same products from abroad. Njombe Regional Commissioner Anthony Mtaka said the thirst of the people of Njombe was to see the factory starting operations as soon as possible and facilitate economic and employment activities. For his part, the Chief Government Pharmacist, Daudi Msasi, said the government through the Ministry of Health will ensure that the factory starts production with no further delays. He said that out of 100 per cent of the medical equipment being imported into the country, the government will be at a position to reduce the amount to 50 per cent in 2030, once such factories are locally built in Tanzania.
