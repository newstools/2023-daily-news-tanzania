TWO businessmen, Jayzan Kuchar alias China and Aloyce Francis, who have been charged with three counts of economic sabotage, including possession of 19 Elephant tusks, have been released on bail after fulfilling the required conditions. Principal Resident Magistrate Mary Mrio said this on in Kisutu Resident Magistrate’s Court in Dar es Salaam on Wednesday after the duo submitted property deeds all worth 70m/- as bond. Each defendant was supposed to submit a title deed worth 35m/-, prompting the case to be adjourned until January 25 this year for a retrial. Meanwhile, the prosecution side in the case facing the Executive Director of Jatu PLC, Peter Gasaya (32), who is charged with fraud of over 5bn/- through false utterance has asked the court to set another date for mentioning, because investigations are incomplete. State Attorney Tumaini Maingu stated this on Wednesday at the Kisutu Resident Magistrate Court before the Principal Resident Magistrate, Francis Mhina. Maingu claimed that the case has been called for mention but the investigation is incomplete. On his part, the defense lawyer, Kung’he Wabeya, asked the court for short notice because he wanted to present an argument about his client’s bond. After listening to the requests, Magistrate Mhina adjourned the case, adding that the defendant will remain in custody until January 13, this year. The prosecution led by Tumaini Maingu told the court that, on diverse dates between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021, within the city of Dar es Salaam, the Chief Executive Director of JATU PL, with intent to defraud, obtained 5.14bn/- from JATU Saccos by falsely pretending that the said amount would be invested in agriculture business, a fact that he knew to be false.
