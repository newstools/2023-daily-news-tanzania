THE National Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) plans to establish a national database for keeping all human health research data findings conducted by various researchers in the country. The database dubbed National Health Research Data Repository (NHRDR) aims at facilitating simplified access to data in case they are demanded. NIMR Director General, Prof Said Aboud said here yesterday when opening the stakeholders’ consultative workshop that the database system will be locally sourced as it will be designed and developed by the Institute’s experts and others from different institutions involved in health issues in the country. Prof Aboud said that after the completion of the database, researchers who conduct their research related to the health sector will submit their reports and publications to be included in the national database system where various stakeholders including government institutions will be able to access them. “The awaited NHRDR system is very important in this time of science and technology for speeding up economic growth. It is part of implementing NIMR’s strategic plan for the health sector,” he said
