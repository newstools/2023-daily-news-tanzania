AT least 60 children aged 14 and younger with congenital heart diseases will get access to free of cost medical care at the Benjamin Mkapa Hospital (BMH) each year commencing this year. The Hospital’s Executive Director, Dr Alphonce Chandika, said here on Tuesday that all the costs will be covered by an India-based Sri Sathya Sai Sanjeevani Hospital, following plans to enter into agreement between BMH and the leading health facility in India. “Plans are underway for the Benjamin Mkapa Hospital to enter Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Sri Sathya Sai Sanjeevan Hospital,” said the hospital’s boss, while briefing the ‘Daily News’ on his recent visit to Kigali, Rwanda where he met leaders of Sri Sathya Sai Sanjeevan Hospital. Dr Chandika said the partnership with the Indian Hospital will see BMH Cardiac Clinic being upgraded, adding that Sri Sathya Sai Sanjeevan Hospital will support the Dodoma-based hospital with medical equipment. “The Sri Sathya Sai Sanjeeevan Hospital will also sponsor training to 15 medics of the BMH to India,” he said. On his part, Head of the Communication and Public Relations Unit at the BMH, Mr Jeremiah Mbwambo, expressed gratitude to the Sri Sathya Sai Sanjeevan Hospital for the support to the BMH. “Serving at least six children with congenital heart disease free of charge each year is showing appreciation to the public. We are giving back to the community,” he said. BMH remains the only health facility in the country to perform kidney transplant by using its very own local medics.
