The Government has allocated 5.64bn/- in the 2022/23 financial year to the Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) to improve the electricity services in Geita region. The Tanesco’s Geita Regional Manager Eng Grace Ntungi presented the budget recently during the Regional Council Committee (RCC) meeting for the half of this financial year. She said the budget is set for improving electricity infrastructures, and improving electricity accessibility. She explained that by December 31, 2022, about 34 projects were implemented, with the biggest priority being on big customers iat mining areas and factories, and areas with no access to power. “Tanesco is in process to implement the Geita-Nyakanazi strategic project to construct a 220kv high voltage line. “This project will also involve supply of electricity to the villages near the project where a total of four villages and 14 townships will benefit where about 7500 new customers will be supplied with electricity. “The current electricity service is 95 per cent satisfactory.
