THE Contractors Registration Board (CRB) has warned contractors about forging documents to elevate their registration criteria and registered as first or second classes. CRB Registrar, Eng Rhoben Nkori said in Dodoma over the weekend that cheating was thwarting their efforts to build the capacity of local contractors. “Many companies are asking to be upgraded. If one evaluates them many fail to meet the quality of the classes they want, most of them want class one and second but miss the required criteria,” Eng Nkori said in Dodoma during the two-day training on Joint Ventures (JVs). “You [contractors] must work hard to reach there,” he added. The registrar said the board will take stern measures against those engaging in not only faking status but also in fake Joint Venture (JVs) projects before they tarnish the entire construction industry. The seminar goal was to build the capacity for local contractors to work and share the experience together even if the forms are in the same class. “I would like to give you a piece of advice to strive to work with large contractors to accumulate experience instead of rushing to upgrade classes by forgery,” Eng Nkori said. Also, he advise them to walk away from the current practice of pretending to be in a JV with a larger contractor. “Venture into a real JV, not the one that pictures you as an escorting company and ending by tarnishing your image,” he said. Assistant Registrar of CRB Research and Development Eng David Jere said the training attracted 103 local contractors of various classes countrywide.
