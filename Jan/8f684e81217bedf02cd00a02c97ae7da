Authorities in Kagera Region have unanimously agreed to establish at least three crops’ production camps under the supervision of the National Service Force (JKT), with aim to stimulate economic activities and production of cash and food crops in the area. The decision was reached during a recent Regional Consultative Committee (RCC), meeting held in Bukoba Municipal Council. Addressing the meeting, the Kagera Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr Albert Chalamila explained that the region had abundant valleys and fertile soil suitable for production of various cash and food crops. “Due to its proximity, Kagera is a gateway to four East African Community (EAC) member states-namely Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda and Kenya across Lake Victoria. But also, it is close to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and South Sudan. This is an attractive market and a golden opportunity for doubling production of cash and food crops, which are on high demand in the EAC countries,” he said. The meeting unanimously agreed to establish at least three production camps under supervision of the JKT in three District Councils-Muleba, Kyerwa and Karagwe. However, no time frame was given for the implementation of the project. The meeting also agreed to set aside about 66,000 hectares of land in Biharamulo District, suitable for  block farming and identified avocado as a promising cash crop. Mr Chalamila also informed the meeting that at least nine irrigation schemes had already been established and directed district commissioners in the eight councils namely Muleba, Bukoba DC, Biharamulo, Ngara, Karagwe, Kyerwa, Missenyi and Bukoba MC to closely supervise the projects.
