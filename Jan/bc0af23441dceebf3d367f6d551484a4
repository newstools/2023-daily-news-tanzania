THE African Union (AU) has successfully deployed a full team of the AU monitoring, verification and Compliance Mission (AU-MVCM) in Mekele, Tigray region, Ethiopia. The deployment of African experts is consistent with article 11 of the agreement, relating to Monitoring, Verification and Compliance of the Permanent Cessation of Hostilities agreement (COHA). The agreement that was signed on 2 November 2022 allows the parties to appoint, through the AU high level panel, a team of experts to monitor the implementation of the permanent cessation of hostilities. Speaking on the move, chairperson of the AU Commission Mousa Faki, commended the parties for continued positive confidence-building measures since the signing of the permanent COHA and congratulated them for the cooperation and collaboration with the AU MVCM since the launch of the mission on 29 December 2022. He further encouraged the parties to continue these significant steps towards the successful implementation of the COHA in efforts to restore peace, security and stability in Ethiopia. “The AU commission expresses its gratitude to the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia FDRE and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) for their commitment to the spirit of African Solutions to African Problems and the AU’s silencing the gun agenda,” he said. Furthermore, the AU commission expressed its appreciation to the governments of Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa as well as multilateral and bilateral partners for their continued support for the AU-led process.
