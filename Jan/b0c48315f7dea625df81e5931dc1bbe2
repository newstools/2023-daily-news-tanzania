THE government has allocated 2bn/- for the construction of a district hospital in Mwanga District  in a bid to spare patients from the hustle of travelling far away in pursuit of medical services. Mwanga District Executive Director Mwajuma Nasombe said here recently that the proposed medical facility will spare Mwanga residents from the burden of travelling all the way to Moshi for medical treatment. “It can be so inconveniencing for someone to board a bus here in Mwanga in search for health services in Moshi. We believe that this facility will without doubt help residents save money and time of pursuing medical attention far away,” opined Ms Nasombe. The District Executive Director, who was touring the construction site of the planned medical facility, disclosed that the project will involve construction of four fully furnished buildings to cater for medical needs in the district. Detailing on the funding, Ms Nasombe said the funds for the project’s first phase, amounting to 1bn/-, had been disbursed from the budget which ended in June 2021, while the remaining amount was remitted to her office on December 4 last year. Some of the facilities that will feature in the project include outpatient department (OPD), radiation services Unit and laboratory and medicine storage facility. In his rejoinder, District Commissioner Abdallah Mwaipaya said the completion of the project will greatly reduce frequent referrals to to Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC) and the Mawenzi Regional Referral Hospital. “If anything, the new facility will have top-notch health services and there’ll be no reason of travelling 40 kilometers to Moshi town,” he added.
