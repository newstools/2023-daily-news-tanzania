THE price of beans in most parts of Dar es Salaam City has risen to a historic level, turning out to be a burden to consumers. The average price of beans climbed to between 3,600/- to 4,200/- for a kilo recently, causing many customers to reduce their consumption to this one time being their favourite meal. A ‘Daily News’ survey in various grain markets in Dar es Salaam City namely Tandika, Gongo la Mboto and Buguruni showed the highest bean grade fetches between 3,600/-  and 4,200/- per kilogramme. The skyrocketing prices have made most citizens dig deeper into their pockets, especially those who depend much on beans and maize as the basic food. A resident of Tandika Ms Zainabu Kassim said the rising food prices have affected the household meal budget while income remains unchanged. “I used to buy a kilo of beans for my family consisting of 5 members when the price was 1,500/- for a kilo. It is hard to buy that quantity when the price is 3,600/- per kilogramme,” Ms Zainabu said. Additionally, Ms Mwajabu Daniel, a food vendor at Gongo la Mboto market expressed her disappointment with the rising prices which she is saying is a heavy burden to bear for the customer since they cannot raise the price of the food plates. “A kilogramme of beans is now ranging between 4,000/- to 4,200/-, it is very disappointing to food vendors,” she said. She added that wheat flour has also increased from 1,200/- to 2,000/- per kilogramme, an increase of at least 1,000/- from the previous price. Furthermore, Mariam Saleh, a food vendor in Buguruni market stressed over the sharp rise in bean prices causing her to reduce the quantity that gives her assurance of selling the whole amount. “I have now reduced the amount of maize flour to 7 kilogrammes costing about 11,900/- after its price shot to 1,700/- per kilogramme from 900/- per kilogramme when I used to buy more than 15 kilogrammes,” she stressed. On her part, Ms Awei Said, a wholesale trader at Gongo la Mboto market said the reason for the sharp price rise is due to the opening of borders where business people from neighbouring countries are competing with the locals thus driving up prices. “The price rise is attributed to the opening of the borders whereby most of the grain is sold to the regional markets,” said Ms Said. Ms Awei also stressed that the high price of beans already hiked by farmers plays a bigger part in the increase of price in the market and this is a burden to the consumers that has caused most of them to look for alternatives. “For example, combat beans are now sold at 330,000/- for 300 kilogrammes for a wholesale price, yellow beans are sold at 360,000/- for 300 kilogrammes and maize flour is sold at 40,000/- for 25 kilogrammes,” she added. According to the wholesale prices of main food crops released by the Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry last month shows that Mtwara Region has the lowest minimum prices for maize grains whereby the price for 100 kilogramme ranges between 80,000/- and 90,000/-, while Tanga Region has the highest price of about 128,000/- and 133,000/- for 100 kilogrammes. For beans grain, Kagera region has the lowest price ranging between 130,000/- and 170,000/- for a 100 kilogramme, while Kinondoni District in Dar es Salaam region registered the highest price between 300,000/- and 350,000/- for 100 kilogrammes. Also, the report shows that Kigoma Region has the lowest price of 230,000/- for 100 kilogrammes while Dodoma recorded the highest price of 365,000/- per 100 kilogrammes.
