EXERCISING for 30 minutes, at least three days of the week is a good way to improve or maintain your overall health, President Hussein Ali Mwinyi insisted this in Pemba on Sunday where he led ‘powerwalking’ to officially begin the 59th anniversary of Zanzibar Revolution. Power-walking or speed walking which involved several leaders in the government, residents, and members of fitness groups from the Mainland,Unguja, and Pemba, was conducted from Tibirinzi grounds to Gombani-ya-kale ground in Chakechake District of South Pemba. “Everyone should take regular physical exercise seriously to minimise risks of contracting Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), currently a global challenge,” Dr Mwinyi said as he commended the Isles Ministry responsible for sports for organising the annual event. This year’s theme for the mass speedy-walking exercise in Pemba, was “Be active, abandon physical inactivity habits, good health is your wealth.” The power-walking held on every 1st of January aims to encourage and promote regular body exercise, unite people, and a fan in celebrating Mapinduzi which brought the end of colonial backed government on January 12, 1964. Dr Mwinyi presented certificates of appreciation to various groups/companies/ institutions and fitness groups for continued support of the exercise which the incumbent Zanzibar President directed to have rotation between Unguja and Pemba. The Minister for Information, Youth, Culture and Sports Tabia Maulid Mwita said at the climax of the powerwalking at ‘Gombani-ya-kale’ ground that her ministry is committed to sustain the event because it benefits many and promotes unity and love to each other. Said Suleiman from the Zanzibar Body Exercise Sports Association (ZABESA) who has been working with the Ministry to organise the power walking, informed the participants at the ground, more needs to be done to encourage and promote regular exercise so that more people get involved.
