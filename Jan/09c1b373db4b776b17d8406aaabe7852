Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has been fined for not wearing a seatbelt in a moving car while filming a social media video. Lancashire Police said it had issued a 42-year-old man from London with a conditional offer of a fixed penalty. No 10 said Mr Sunak “fully accepts this was a mistake and has apologised”, adding that he would pay the fine. Passengers caught failing to wear a seat belt when one is available can be fined £100. This can increase to £500 if the case goes to court. The prime minister was in Lancashire when the video was filmed, during a trip across the north of England. The video – to promote the government’s latest round of “levelling up” spending – was posted on Mr Sunak’s Instagram account. It is the second time Mr Sunak has received a fixed penalty notice while in government. Last April, he was fined along with Boris Johnson and wife Carrie for breaking Covid lockdown rules – by attending a birthday gathering for the then-prime minister in Downing Street in June 2020.
