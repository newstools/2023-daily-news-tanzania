NORTH Mara Gold Mine says the UK-based organisation, Rights and Accountability in Development (RAID) has accepted the longstanding invitation to visit the mine during the week commencing 30 January this year. “The intention of the site visit will be to show RAID the numerous initiatives North Mara has implemented to improve the lives and livelihoods of our surrounding communities, gain a contextual understanding of the operating environment at North Mara and meet with key stakeholders in the region,” Barrick said in a statement. North Mara and RAID will also discuss RAID’s findings and methodology and pursue practical recommendations. North Mara Gold Mine and other stakeholders look forward to hosting and engaging with the raid team during the visit.
