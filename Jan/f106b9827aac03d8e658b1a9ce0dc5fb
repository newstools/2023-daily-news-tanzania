Singida Big Stars coach Hans Van Pluijm has credited his players following a 4 -1 victory against Azam FC during the semifinals match held at the Amaan Stadium in Zanzibar on Sunday. Singida’s victory pushed the club to the finals of 2023 Mapinduzi Cup. DR Congo imported striker Francy Kazadi scored a quadruple on the day for Singida Big Stars whereas Abdul Sopu netted the consolation goal for Azam. “I give credit to all my players for the good performance which has necessitated us to progress into the finals,” says Pluijm. This is the first time for his side to compete in Mapinduzi Cup as they eye to clinch it to stamp a lifetime club’s record. His counterpart for Azam Kali Ongala conceded the defeat saying they played below average. “I congratulate them (Singida Big Stars) for the deserved victory, they played better than us,” he insists. Azam joined Simba and Young Africans in a class of three Tanzania mainland teams to exit the contest prematurely.
