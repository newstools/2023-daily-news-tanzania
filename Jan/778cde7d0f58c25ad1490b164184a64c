TANZANIA Police Force has allayed fears over possible terrorist attacks by insisting the country is safe. The Force issued a statement on Thursday (January 26, 2023), following USA Embassy security alert issued on Wednesday which advised   USA citizens and other citizens in Dar es Salaam and elsewhere in the country to take precaution. However, Police Spokesperson, Senior Assistant Commissioner of Police (SACP) David Misime on Thursday assured the public of their safety and urged them to remain calm and continue with their daily businesses. On Wednesday the US Embassy in Dar es Salaam warned that: “terrorist groups could attack with little or no warning targeting hotels, embassies, restaurants, malls and markets, police stations, mosques and other frequented places by Westerners.” But the Tanzania Police Force has assured the public that the country is safe.
