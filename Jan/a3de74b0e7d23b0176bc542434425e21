GEITA Gold’s Head Coach Fred Minziro said he will recruit seven new players in the ongoing mini-transfer  window to strengthen his squad. Minziro said the departure of a large number of players has weakened the team to the point of not getting good results in their recent Premier League matches. According to him, the players who have parted ways with his team are Saido Ntibazonkiza who has joined Simba, Yusufu Kagoma  who joined Singida Big Stars, Adeyum Salehe who has moved to Dodoma Jiji and George Mpole who has joined FC Lupopo of Democratic Republic of Congo. Other outgoing players are Yahya Mbegu and Juma Mahadhi. “I have spoken to the club’s management to set aside an amount of money for adding seven new players whom I believe will bring the team back to the competition like the last season,’ he said. He further added that the main goal this season is to finish the league in the top- four positions as how they did last season. He said despite the existing difficulties, if they succeed in signing the players he has proposed, there is a hope of returning to the CAF Confederation Cup next season. On his side Geita Gold defender Yahya Mbegu has confirmed partying ways with his former team. He said he wrote a letter to the management seeking to terminate his contract and he now waits for the response. In the Premier League standings, Geita Gold are placed 7th with 24 points after playing 19 games. The team has won five, drawn nine and lost five matches. They have scored 21 and conceded 16 goals. Geita Gold will play their next match against Dodoma Jiji FC at Jamhuri Stadium in Dodoma on February 2nd this year after that they will return to Nyankumbu stadium in Geita to host Polisi Tanzania five days later.
