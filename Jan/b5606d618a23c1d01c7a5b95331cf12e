NMB has rolled out the 10th round of the campaign to promote the bank’s payment cards where the number of weekly winners has now reached 760. The Morogoro Wami Branch Manager Mr Harold Lambileki said over the weekend that 10 out of the total number of winners won a motorcycle each while the remaining pocketed 100,000/- each. “The NMB MastaBata-Kote Kote campaign aimed at promoting the use of payment cards has been very successful,” he said. In the 10th round of the campaign, the bank picked the last batch of winners who pocketed 7.5m/- and one getting a brand new motorcycle. In the raffle, the motorbike went to Ms Tulanana Leah Bohela, a journalist from Dar es Salaam, who commended NMB for the digital finance initiative that also sought to empower its clients economically. She added that all users of NMB Mastercard and NMB Mastercard QR have equal chances to win the grand prize provided they transacted more digitally. According to him, the MastaBata campaign series also seek to reward loyal customers of the bank. MastaBata IV, which started last October, also comprised two monthly draws in which 98 customers won a total of 98m/- and another four a motorcycle each. NMB Bank debuted the series in 2018 to drive increased use of the NMB Mastercard and NMB Mastercard QR digital payment cards. Season one of the partnerships with payment industry giant Mastercard International was simply dubbed MastaBata. This was followed by MastaBata Sio Kawaida and then MastaBata – KivyakoVyako, which ushered in the over 300m/- Kote-Kote version.
