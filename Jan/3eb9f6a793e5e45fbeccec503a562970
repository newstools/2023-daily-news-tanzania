THE Zanzibar Commissioner of Police (CP) Hamad Khamis Hamad has said applicants without the required academic qualifications will not be considered for recruitment in the police force. “We are being guided by the Police General Order (PGO). The minimum required academic qualification is Ordinary Secondary School Division IV, with at least four passes in any subjects excluding religion, as it is not recognized by NACTE (National Examinations Council of Tanzania,” said Hamad. He was reacting to complaints raised by some young job seekers and parents against what they claimed to be biased procedures in recruiting new police officers. They argued that some young people are not being considered for employment for unspecific reasons. CP Hamad said that only young people with proper academic qualification will be considered for the jobs because the force need officers, who can serve people fairly and easily adapt to the changing world in science and technology. The CP said that they are determined to build professional police force in which, education background remains crucial in achieving the intended goal. “If we want to succeed in reforming our police force, we must ensure that we continue to recruit on merits,” insisted Mr Hamad.
