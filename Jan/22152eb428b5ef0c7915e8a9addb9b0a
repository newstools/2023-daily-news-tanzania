MUSOMA Rural residents have expressed gratitude to the government for dishing out 250m/- for the construction of water infrastructure at Makojo and Chimati villages. According to the Musoma Rural Member of Parliament, Prof Sospeter Muhongo, Chimati residents will get water from a 100,000-litre water tank which has been constructed at Makojo. A 75,000-litre tank has also been constructed at Chitare village. Prof Muhongo said the water has been drawn from a Lake at Chitare village and called upon the villagers to continue protecting water infrastructure in the villages. The Musoma Rural lawmaker commended the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (RUWASA) for regularly conducting maintenance of the water infrastructures in the villages. He revealed such maintenance has ensured reliable supply of water to Wanyere, Mikuyu, Nyambono, Saragana, Kanderema, Bugoji and Kaburabura dwellers. “People in Musoma Rural are grateful to the government under the leadership of President Samia Suluhu Hassan for continuing to provide funds for the supply of clean and safe water,” Prof Muhongo said. Early this month, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Water, Engineer Anthony Sanga directed water authorities in Mara region to ensure timely commencement of a water project that aims at supplying the precious liquid to Tegeruka and Mugango wards in Musoma Rural District. He said the commencement of the project in February this year will help to meet the deadline of the project which is set for June 2023. The PS issued the directives before the Musoma Rural MP Professor Sospeter Muhongo during the rallies held separately in the areas. The instructions were directed to Musoma Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Authority (MUWASA), Mugango-Kiabakari-Butiama Water Authority and Rural Water and Sanitation Agency (RUWASA).
