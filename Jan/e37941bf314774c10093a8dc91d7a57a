YOUNG Africans said their newly-signed Malian center-back Mamadou Doumbia will make his Premier League debut in their Monday game against Ruvu Shooting at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium. Initially, the game was to be staged today before being shifted to Monday to enable the venue to host other scheduled activities. However, speaking yesterday in the city, Yanga’s Media and Communication Manager Ally Kamwe said if all goes well, Doumbia will serve the club on the day. “He will be present during our next match against Ruvu Shooting on Monday if Head Coach Nasreddine Nabi decides to parade him. “He will be a surprise package like what Kennedy Musonda did when he was introduced in the second half during a match with Ihefu when his entry helped to increase the squad’s tempo until we scored a few minutes after his introduction,” he said. Much is expected from the Malian defender who was included in Mali national team squad and played in the Africa Nations Championship (CHAN) finals in Algeria as its captain. But he has been compelled to make a U-turn by ignoring the finals to join his new club ahead of the crucial league and the CAF Confederation Cup games. Meanwhile, Yanga squad is now complete following the return of three players; Stephanie Aziz Ki, Bernard Morrison, and Yannick Bangala who missed the previous action. Heading to Monday’s encounter, the Jangwani Street club continues to float at the peak of the table with 53 points after playing 20 matches. For Ruvu Shooting, it is the same old story as they struggle to make ends meet no wonder, they have just stamped three wins from 20 games played in the ongoing campaign. They have lost 12 games and drawn five making it an unpleasant run for them and with nine matches to go before the season ends, the only way for them to avoid relegation is by winning most of their remaining matches.
