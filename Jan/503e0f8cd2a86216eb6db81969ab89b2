The Ministry of Health has begun an HIV self-testing service at workplaces that aims to facilitate access to HIV testing services to workers, especially men. Deputy Minister for Health Dr Godwin Mollel revealed this on Friday in Dodoma saying that reaching December 2022, about 96,231 people had been provided with the JIPIME service at their workplaces. Additionally, Dr Mollel said, in December 2022 they reached out to a total of 47,705 adolescents (20,329 boys and 27,376 girls) in about 103 schools through a campaign dubbed ‘Kipepeo’. “We are expecting to conduct the same campaign this year in Dodoma, Singida, Morogoro, Tanga and Geita regions,” Dr Mollel said. However, he said that in 2022 the ministry in collaboration with Tanzania Commission for AIDS (TACAIDS) and the Ministry of Education has been able to provide gender education training to about 5,033 teachers in the country.
