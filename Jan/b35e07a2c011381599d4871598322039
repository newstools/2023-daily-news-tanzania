THE Dar es Salaam Rapid Transit Agency (DART), has allocated four large buses to ferry students to and from school early in the morning and evening to complement government efforts of ensuring access to education to all eligible Tanzanians children. According to DART the buses will transport primary and secondary schools students along Kimara- Kivukon, Kimara – Gerezani major routes and other feeder roads include Kibaha, Mwenge, Mlonganzia and Muhimbili. DART Acting Chief Executive officer Dr Philemon Mzee, said in an interview this week that t the move is meant to boost implementation of the free education policy as easing transportation improves the learning environment. Apart from easing transportation, the buses also give students an opportunity to study while on the rapid bus and to discuss various school topics together. The routes which starts at as early as 06 O’clock in the morning comprises  Kimara – Kivukoni, Kimara – gerezani while linked to  Morocco  area and students also joins feeder routes to Kibaha, Mwenge and Mlonganzia and Muhimbili. DART started with two buses in 2021 but the response shows increasing demand so it decided to add two more buses, he said, pointing out that the buses are the bigger type with a capacity for 150 adults. So far students from six schools in Kimara, seven schools in Kivukoni and 14 schools in the Gerezani zone use the special services, he elaborated, noting that the service followed a survey on learners’ needs along the BRT corridor. DART reached this decision after President Samia built more classrooms and hired teachers thus increasing school enrollment. According to Dr Mzee in the evening hours, the rapid transit buses dedicated for students will start offering service to schoolchildren to return home from Kivukoni to Kimara from 16:30 and 17:00 hours and from Gerezani to Kimara terminals “This service is indeed useful, going with the government’s plans as it has helped many students to go to school and return home earlier …we hope that it will help to improve students’ performance,” he said.
