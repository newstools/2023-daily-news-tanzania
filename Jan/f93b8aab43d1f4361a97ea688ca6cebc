UNIVERSAL Health Coverage (UHC) will significantly help increase access to health care to those who could not afford the services, according to the Benjamin Mkapa Hospital (BMH) Executive Director, Dr Alphonce Chandika. Addressing a recent symposium on UHC here, Dr Chandika, said it was vital for every member of the community to join the UHC, if it is endorsed, so that they benefit from the programme. “Universal Health Coverage will increase access to health care scope to those who could not afford services currently,” said the hospital’s boss during the symposium which brought together religious leaders and local government leaders. Dr Chandika expressed gratitude to the government for introducing the UHC and that the new programme will address challenges for those who could not afford health services. He used the opportunity to urge religious leaders to advise their followers to join the UHC programme when it kicks off in July 1st this year. Dr Chandika said the UHC is in line with the ruling party CCM manifesto to make sure that every member of the community gets access to better health, saying the manifesto is geared towards better health care.
