President Samia Suluhu Hassan has told youth in the country to be creative and invest in self-employment by building a low economy for their betterment and to help the government. She made the call on Tuesday during the summit of the UVCCM Special Walk to celebrate the 59th Anniversary of Zanzibar Revolution in Zanzibar while mentioning areas like blue economy and agriculture as better places to invest in. “You have been having the same projects, if your fellow puts up a brick factory, there will be brick factories every three or one kilometers you will find a brick factory. If others set up a shop, then everyone opens a shop, the same thing to salons. Come up with new ideas,” Elaborating, the President dismissed complaints from different areas where people have been demanding the government to provide employment to youth saying that their duty is to create conducive environment for self-employment. “What we are doing is to create a conducive environment for you to create jobs. Create jobs by using the existing environment. Have small projects…have new ideas that are marketable and by doing so you will have worked on micro economics,” she insisted. Meanwhile, the Chairperson of the ruling Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCM) asked members of the youth wing of the ruling party, UVCCM to get prepared and use the political rallies opportunity by arguing with facts and avoiding all sorts’ chaos. “The era of quarreling and abusing each other in politics should end.
