At least 16 people were killed when a passenger bus rammed into a stationary lorry on Friday morning on Uganda’s highway that links the capital, Kampala, to the northern town of Gulu. Police say 12 people died on the spot while four others died later at a hospital. Several other travellers on the bus were injured. The lorry was said to have been parked and loading cargo about a kilometre from Kamdini Corner – a popular stopover and checkpoint in the north of the country. There have been worrying levels of road carnage in the country in recent weeks and especially over the festive season. A traffic police report earlier this week revealed that 104 road accidents had been recorded between 30 December and 1 January. At least 35 people were killed in these road crashes alone. Road accidents have been a long-running crisis in the country. Traffic police registered over 4,000 crashes across Uganda in 2021, many of them fatal.
