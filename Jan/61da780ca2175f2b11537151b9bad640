JAKAYA Kikwete Cardiac Institute (JKCI) is set to extend its services to Chato District in Geita Region in efforts to expand cardiovascular care, training and research in the country. The Minister for Health, Ms Ummy Mwalimu said during her visit on Saturday to JKCI-Dar Group Hospital that JKCI will expand its wings to Chato, where there is a big opportunity for the JKCI to help not only Tanzanians but also people from neighboring countries. “It will be better for the institute to expand to Chato District because there is enough space for patients and even an area for exercises,” said Ms Mwalimu. The extension plan comes after the minister saw the impressive work done by the institute under the JKCI Executive Director, Dr Peter Kisenge, in improving the Dar Group to become a better hospital for cardiovascular treatments. Apart from extension of the cardiac institute, Minister Mwalimu said that the government is looking forward to seeing the JKCI-Dar group become a hospital that will treat children under 15 years with heart complications. Elaborating on the same, Dr Kisenge disclosed that the hospital was doing its best in providing services that are of high quality to its patients and that since November last year there has been an increase of number of patients from 400 to 600 per day.  “I and my fellow members have a plan of making JKCI hospital to become an international hospital that will serve people to its fullest not only in Tanzania but also the neighboring countries. With JKCI-Dar group hospital is here to help to reduce overcrowding of patients at the JKCI Headquarters,” said Dr Kisenge. On her side, Chief Medical Officer, Tumaini Nagu, said that JKCI is among 25 institutions in the world offering specialised heart treatment with specialists who are capable of helping people and give them all recommended medicine to the patient.
