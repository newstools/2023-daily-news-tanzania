Young Africans player Feisal Salum is set to appear before the Legal and Players Status Committee of the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) tomorrow. A letter signed by Herman Kidifu for TFF General Secretary indicates that they received a complaint against Feisal from his club regarding the status of his contract. “By this letter, you are summoned to appear in personal and your legal advisor before the committee on Wednesday, 4th day of January 2023 at TFF Office, Karume Memorial Stadium, Dar es Salaam for hearing of the complaint,” it reads. There has been a tug-of-war between Feisal and his club whereby the former is allegedly forcing his way out of the club while the latter claims he has a valid contract until 2024. The Jangwani street based side insist that some important details were not properly followed by the player in his effort to terminate the contract. However, Feisal’s last match to play for Yanga before the eruption of the saga was a 3-0 win against Coastal Union at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium on December 20th. He has so far missed two matches versus Azam and a recent away trip against Mtibwa Sugar of white Yanga have triumphed in both instances.
