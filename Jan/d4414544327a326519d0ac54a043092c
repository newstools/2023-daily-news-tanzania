THE government has announced results for students who last year sat for the Procurement and Supplies Professionals and Technical Board (PSPTB) examinations which show that the number of candidates who failed some subjects is still high. Announcing the results in Dodoma on Friday, PSPTB Executive Director, Mr Godfrey Mbanyi said the exams were held between 22 and 25 November, 2022 and that a total of 1,216 persons registered to sit for the professional exams, whereas 1,135 sat for the examinations equal to 93.3 per cent. However, he noted, out of that number, 452 were new while 683 sat for supplementary exams. “The results show that a total of 613 candidates (54 per cent) passed the exams whereas 474 (41.8) candidates will have to come for supplementary exams,” he said. “In the exams 48 candidates (4.2 per cent) failed completely in all the subjects at different levels,” said Mr Mbanyi. In all the 34 subjects, he added, only 18 of them were attempted well, 10 were performed on average while six others were poorly done, meaning, they were done below average. The PSPTB boss further noted that had put up several plans for the future including strengthening and intensifying supervision on the training provided at all review centres. Others according to him were intensifying relationship with other academic institutions in efforts to increase the pass rate, taking proper use of social media and other modern technologies of education provision. He also said that his institution would start offering training via a newly approved curriculum come November 2023, asking all institutions offering professional training to prepare their students psychologically.
