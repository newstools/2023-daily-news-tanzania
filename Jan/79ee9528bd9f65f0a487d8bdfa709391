IN ensuring that artists and arts stakeholders enjoy their working environment, the government has urged reggae artists to formalise their works in order to convey a permit of performing in and outside the country. The message was conveyed by the Assistant  Acting Principal of Music in  Tanzania Arts Council (BASATA), Oden Manyaga during the Reggae and Dancehall music awards ceremony known as “Kukaye Moto Awards 2022” held in Ubungo, Dar es Salaam recently. “I ask Reggae and Dancehall music artists to register so that their works are known and be easy for them to get permission to perform because the government has good intentions with artists as it promotes their works and helps them economically,” he said. He also said reggae music has been of great benefit in this country, especially in educating the community about various things as well as promoting the economy through the music and its sensible messages. Manyaga also advised the artists not to sort professional  obstacles alone, rather they should involve the experts from the National Arts Council as they have the answers to the artistic obstacles. In addition to, the arts council has commended the individual artists, groups, music recording studios, music label owners, graphic designers, art associations, and entertainment and entertainment venues to update their information in the AMIS system. On his side, the Secretary of Kukaye Moto Tanzania, Samson Karume thanked the government for the way it has chosen to fight for the arts and culture sector, which has encouraged the morale among artists to work hard to produce songs with sustainable content. “The aim of these awards is to encourage reggae music artists to be able to give value nationally and internationally and to advertise their work if they organize a big festival that will bring together various reggae artists,” he said. The Kukaye Moto 2022 awards have been held with high efficiency while being distributed in 23 aspects of reggae and dance hall music in the country.
