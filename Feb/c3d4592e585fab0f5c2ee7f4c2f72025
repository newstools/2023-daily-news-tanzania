YOUNG Africans Head Coach Nasreddine Nabi said  winning maximum points matters more than playing entertaining game as Namungo’s Denis Kitambi for Namungo conceded the 2-0 loss. Yanga reclaimed their 6-point lead at the summit of the Premier League table courtesy of goals from Dickson Job and Stephanie Aziz Ki  at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam over the weekend. It was their ninth straight win and have gone in record books for becoming the first team to win 9 consecutive league matches as they continue to clear their path towards this season’s coveted trophy. For Namungo, the loss deprived them a chance to leapfrog Geita Gold who remained fifth while Namungo are glued at the sixth position with 29 points from 22-game outings. “We did not play well because some of the players were coming from injury like Khalid Aucho and others but the most important thing is the win,” said the Tunisian coach during a post-match meeting. He added that rotation of players was inevitable as they need to give every player some minutes to play in order to showcase their capabilities. The Jangwani Street giants have since reached 59 points in 22 matches as they are eyeing to defend the league title for the second time in a row. On his part, Namungo trainer Kitambi conceded the loss saying they played well, but they were shy at the goal mouth. “We have given away two simple goals despite dominating the play, but in football, such incidents occur most often and we just need to look up for other upcoming fixtures to record positive results,” he said. Adding, Kitambi said he was impressed with the way his charges approached the second half saying they succeeded to dominate the play by pressuring hard the hosts. “We have conceded two cheap goals against a big team and that is the difference between us. Anyway, the season is not yet over and we have to keep our heads up for other fixtures,” he said.
