THE Mwanza-based Championship side, Pamba have come up with a ‘Green Project’ whose aim is to produce talented youth for the future benefit of the team. Explaining the three-year project (2023-2026), the club’s FC Chairman Aleem Alibhai said the project is dwelt on starting a football championship for the young players aged between 15 and 17 years who will be assembled in the centres specially made for nurturing and developing football talents in the Mwanza region. Alibhai said their team has paraded the image of football in Mwanza region for a long time but failed to produce players who become famous in Tanzania such as Khalid Bitebo, Choki Abeid, Joram Mwakatika and Fumo Felician or Ibrahim Magongo. He said their target is to get 25 players who will be selected and placed in the camp in Bagamoyo to participate in various youth competitions managed by the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) and other institutions so that they will be useful in the future. “We have thought of investing in Mwanza football by coming up with the Green Project, a solid three-year project to get Pamba as strong as it was in the 1970s and the 80s, we have decided to imitate and develop the culture that our colleagues were doing and be successful where we will produce players who will come from Pamba itself,” he explained. He said their project will start any time this February. He said they will start a competition that will involve football academy centres here in Mwanza for children aged 15-17 to find 25 players who we will send to the camp in Bagamoyo. “We need the support of every stakeholder in this project to produce the intended products and raise talents so that we can reduce the number of players from outside and registration costs in the future,” he said. Pamba’s Secretary General Johnson James said their project will help their senior team as many players will be selected and join their senior team.
