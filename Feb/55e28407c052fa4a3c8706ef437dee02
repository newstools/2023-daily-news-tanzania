PRESIDENT Samia Suluhu Hassan announced Monday she intends to create other new Ministries that will be under the Office of the President, explaining the new dockets will be related to the Treasury Registrar, Planning and Investment Commission. “We have seen people asking, there is a Permanent Secretary for Investments, why doesn’t he have a Minister. We have introduced the Permanent Secretary to help us organize what we want. We want three important areas to return under the Office of the President. When we finish the legislation processes they will become full ministries… but for now we are bringing in the Treasury Registrar, the Planning and Investment Commission – TIC,” she said while swearing in new leaders at the Chamwino State House in Dodoma .
