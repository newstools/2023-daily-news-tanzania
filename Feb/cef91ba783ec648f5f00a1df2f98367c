FOOTBALL fans in Kagera have lauded President Samia Suluhu Hassan for her timely intervention and promise to award 5m/- for every goal the Tanzanian Simba and Young Africans score in their CAF governed duels this weekend. Jacob Kilyanga, a former striker with Balimi FC and coach  said the motivation is timely and will  bring positive results to the two country’s representatives. “ On behalf of Kagera soccer fans, I  commend President Samia for the support. When the Head of State intervenes in soccer it means a lot……this is a new chapter we are witnessing. It is my hope that the two clubs will take advantage of this promise and emerge victorious in their pairings,” he said. Sauda Hassan (23), a resident of Kashai Ward, in Bukoba Municipal Council, on the other hand, appealed to Tanzanians to support the two envoys and should put aside their clubs’ fanatism. “We need support from all Tanzanians. The win of the two clubs is for all Tanzanians, “she said. Simba are in group C of CAF Champions League and will host Moroccan side Raja Casablanca  over the weekend. Young Africans, on the other hand, will be hosting TP Mazembe  on Sunday, being a Group D match of the CAF Confederation Cup. Both the Kariakoo-based clubs lost their away outings and they need to win their second matches to keep alive their hopes in CAF Champions League and Confederation Cup tournaments. Both teams will play their matches at the Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Tanzania’s commercial capital of Dar es Salaam.
