UHURU Torch Race 2023 is set to cast its light on five development projects worth 2.6bn/- in Mtwara District Council, Mtwara Region. The District’s Uhuru Torch Race Coordinator Mr Nicholas Muya made the revelation here, saying the Uhuru Torch race will land in the district on April 3, 2023. The race will hit various parts in Mtwara District Council after the official launch at national level in Mtwara Region to be held in Nangwanda Stadium in Mtwara town. “Five development projects are expected to be inaugurated during the Uhuru Torch to be raced for two days by Mtwara District Council,” he said. He named the development projects as a water project, cashew nuts farming project, chicken farming project and a dormitory for accommodating girls with special needs in Nanguruwe Primary School. He said the Uhuru torch will inspect the 60 hectares cashew nuts farming project, launch a 1.7 kilometres road and a water project set to provide water services to ‘wananchi’ in the district. On the other hand, Mr Muya said the district is well prepared to host the Uhuru torch race, saying special committees have been already organised to ensure the projects lined up for the race meet value for money criteria. “We have already assembled special committees to thoroughly inspect the projects and make sure they meet all the criteria including value for money and in case there are any irregularities we will act immediately,” he said. He said the committees are inspecting and putting all the required documents of the development projects for proper inspection. Meanwhile, Mr Muya said the district is also set to conduct various social activities to raise awareness of the Uhuru torch race. “Some of the activities include organising sports competition activities to raise public awareness on Uhuru Torch Race 2023 in our district,” he said.
