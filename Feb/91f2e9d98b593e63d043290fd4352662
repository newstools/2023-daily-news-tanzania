THE government has devised a strategic plan to construct new and renovate existing parking lots in various urban centres, the House of Representatives heard here on Friday. Minister of State, President’s Office, Regional Administration, Local Governments and Special Departments, Mr Masoud Ali Mohammed acknowledged before the house that many parking lots under local governments were in pathetic condition but assured that the government is keen to renovate them. He cited the launching of Darajani Shopping Bazaar by President Hussein Mwinyi this morning as part of the government’s efforts to improve parking services in the city. The Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) – owned investment, which had been on construction for over a year under strategic investors, has space to accommodate 100 vehicles. The minister was answering a question by Special Seats Representative, Ms Fatma Ramadhan Mohammed who raised concern over the local governments’ tendency to collect parking fees without reinventing in improvement of the facilities. She argued that the inclination by the city, municipal and town councils to charge motorists for parking services without improving the parking lots doesn’t augur well with the central government commitment to improve social services to the citizens. The minister conceded the weakness, saying many parking spaces in the country face challenges, promising to rectify the problem.
