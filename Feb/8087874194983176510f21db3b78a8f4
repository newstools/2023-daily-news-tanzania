EXPECTANT mothers in Arusha have a reason to smile following prospects of the M-Mama launch later next month. Vodacom Tanzania Managing Director Philip Besiimire said the much awaited service will extend a helping hand to pregnant mothers, as far as emergency services are concerned. Mr Besimiire who was speaking at the weekend after wrapping up his tour of Muriet Health Centre, said the emergency service will greatly address maternal and child care in the country. “I’m pretty much confident that the service that will go live in March will, to a larger extent support post delivery services,” disclosed the Vodacom Tanzania MD. According to Mr Besimiire, Arusha will be the seventh region to host such a service once it gets launched. Detailing on his visit to the health centre, the Vodacom Tanzania boss said it was meant to inspect some of the donations provided to the centre by the mobile operator. “We are thrilled and appreciative to see all the equipment in good shape, we hope they’ll be used for the intended purpose,” he said. Some of the 32.5m/- worth of equipment donated by Vodacom Tanzania include a suction machine, baby warmer, pulse oximeter, oxygen concentrator and a phototherapy. In his rejoinder, a Medical Officer in Charge of the health centre, Dr Hamis Balewa Luhindi thanked the mobile operator for the noble gesture of improving maternal deliveries at the health centre. “The equipment came in handy not only for children but for adults as well, especially during Covid-19,” explained Dr Luhindi. In the same vein, the Medical Officer in Charge appealed to the mobile operator, through Vodacom Tanzania Foundation to provide them with an ambulance to assist patients who require emergency medical assistance at critical moments, helping them to reach the hospital on time and thus saving their life. For her part, Vodacom Tanzania Foundation Deputy Director Annette Kanora commended the health centre for putting the equipment to good use since they were donated.
