The delegation will visit Goma in DRC, Kigali in Rwanda and Bujumbura in Burundi and the regional commissioner Mr Albert Chalamila will lead the team. The Kagera’s Tanzania Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (TCCIA), Executive Secretary, Mr Mali Rwechungura told the ‘Daily News’ in an interview that the visit aims to open the entrepreneurs’ eyes to several opportunities available in the bloc. “We are trying to strategize on how Tanzanian [Kagera] business community can benefit, in an orderly manner, from the opportunities available in neighbouring EAC countries,” Mr Rwechungura said. Tanzania’s Ambassador to Burundi, Dr Jilly Maleko, organised the trade exchange visit.
