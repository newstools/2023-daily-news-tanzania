THE government through Zanzibar Ports Corporation (ZPC) has no immediate plan to construct passenger port at Chake Chake, the House of Representatives heard on Wednesday. Deputy Minister of Infrastructure, Communication and Transport Nadir Abdullatif Yussuf told the house that ZPC is instead determined to upgrade Mkoani and Wete ports and equip them with modern facilities to provide quality services to the islanders. Answering a question by Kojani Representative Hassan Hamad Omar who wanted to know the government plan to construct the passenger port at Chake Chake, the deputy minister said currently Mkoani facility is under renovation works. He further said the feasibility study for Wete Port is on the final stages before the reconstruction works start.
