STANBIC Bank on Tuesday donated 150 desks to Gerezani and Dar es Salaam secondary schools under its Madawati Initiative campaign. The handover ceremony was held at Dar es Salaam Secondary School and was graced by Ilala Member of Parliament, Mr Mussa Zungu who is also the Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly. Mr Zungu said, when delivering his keynote speech, that the donation aligned with the government’s agenda of improving the quality of education and the learning outcomes and environments for children, youth, and adults at all educational institutions. “This is an excellent initiative not only is the bank donating desks but is also planting trees across the country in each school it donates to.This will have a lasting impact by mitigating the environmental impacts of tree cutting which adversely affects the climate making the initiative commendable and worth replicating,” he said. The donation demonstrates the bank’s commitment to supporting the education sector. On the other hand, Mr Omari Mtiga, the Head of Consumer and High Net Worth Clients at Stanbic, said the donation was part of the ongoing Madawati Initiative to distribute desks and trees across the country to create a conducive learning environment for students. “This year, the Stanbic Madawati Initiative aims to donate 1000 desks in different schools to curb desk shortages and provide students with a suitable learning environment,” Mr Mtiga said. The bank is committed to improving livelihoods through programs that support sustainable development, including education. Dar es Salaam Secondary School Head Teacher, Mr Hossain Njau, applauded the bank for the donation, saying that the donation has completely eliminated the shortage of desks in the school and will greatly enhance their performance. The event was also attended by local government officials, students from the school, and staff from Stanbic Bank.
