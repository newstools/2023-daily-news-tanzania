Young Africans says playmaker Stephanie Aziz Ki is a doubt ahead of their game versus TP Mazembe at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam on Sunday. The two teams meet in group D clash of CAF Confederation Cup battling for maximum points. However, Yanga’s Head Coach Nasreddine Nabi at a pre-match briefing in the city on Saturday afternoon says “Aziz Ki is a doubt.” “He missed two training sessions due to personal reasons as such; we are going to assess his fitness during the final training program later today. “Thereafter, we will know whether to start him or not because tomorrow’s match demands players who are 100 percent fit,” says him. He also narrates that midfielder Salum Abubakar ‘Sure Boy’ still not be part of the game as he has been permitted to attend to his sick child who is set to undergo surgery. For Bernard Morrison, Nabi says he is yet to recover from the injury he picked during the past Premier League match against Azam FC.
