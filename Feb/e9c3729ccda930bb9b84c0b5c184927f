THE Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) said they have started procedures to find a new Head Coach for Taifa Stars and the process is at advanced stage. TFF said on Friday that coach needed should be the one with vast knowledge of Tanzania and African football. This was declared by the federation’s Technical Director Oscar Mirambo who cemented that they have taken a long time in order to get the right coach with desired qualities. “Of course, we have lately experienced frequent hire and fire syndrome of senior team coaches which is not healthy in football that is why, this time, we want to be serious. “The main criteria we want from the incoming coach is that he should be the one with adequate knowledge of Tanzania and African football at large. “Some coaches we previously hired, after the first game in charge, have been complaining that our players do not have basics of football hence they cannot deliver. “If a coach says that, it means he has already been sidelined to achieve the targets we have agreed beforehand and in order to avoid this, we are looking for the one with a massive understanding of our football,” Mirambo said. He continued: “We want somebody with adequate knowledge of the nature of our players, and infrastructure we have and yet agree to achieve the set up objectives.” He then cemented that soon, the public will be informed about the new coach to take helm of the national team ahead of the upcoming busy international schedules. Queried if Zambian trainer Honour Janza could be tasked to take the responsibilities, Mirambo replied that he is among the key candidates and they already know well his coaching background. Janza was named Kim Poulsen successor when the latter was dropped to coach the country’s junior flag carrier sides after a zigzag performance with the team.
