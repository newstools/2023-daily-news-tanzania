MWANZA-based Pamba have warned their opponents Mbeya Kwanza to expect turbulence in their Championship League match at Maji Maji Stadium in Ruvuma. The team’s Assistant Coach, Godfrey Chappa, whose side is struggling to earn a Premier League return after a 22- year absence, has warned their opponents they should not expect an easy ride when they meet on Saturday. Speaking about his team’s preparations, Chappa said his players are well-drilled and he is confident that they will work hard to ensure they post positive results which he said will pave their way to the Premier League. “In the first leg match, we lost 3-0 to Mbeya Kwanza in a match played at Nyamagana stadium. This time we are now prepared to make sure we win the match’’ He said. Chappa has called upon a football fraternity in Mwanza to support their team whenever they play whether it is at home or away venues. The tactician said he is impressed with the way his team performed in their last four friendly matches. They won 8-0 against Bende Boys and won 7-0 against Kantandala Sugar. They beat Chipu FC by 3-0 and Small boys by 6-1. All matches were played at Nelson Mandela Stadium in Rukwa. On his side, the team’s skipper Salim Sheshe said they will work very hard to ensure they win the away match. After facing Mbeya Kwanza, Pamba will return to Mwanza to play Copco Veteran on February 12th and on February 18th this year they will host Biashara United, both matches to be staged at Nyamagana Stadium. Pamba FC are placed third with 31 points from 16-game outings. They won ten, drew one and lost five matches. Pamba have netted twenty and conceded sixteen goals.
