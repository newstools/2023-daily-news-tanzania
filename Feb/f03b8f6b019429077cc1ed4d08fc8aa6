CHILD abuse remains a serious problem in Zanzibar, with over 5,500 children molested in a five-year period, the House of Representatives was told on Wednesday. Deputy Minister of Community Development, Gender, Elders and Children Anna Athanas Paul told the house that during the 2017â€”2022 period, 5,512 child molestation cases were reported in various police stations in the country. Answering a question by Pandani Representative Professor Omar Fakih Hamad over 5,500 children molested in a five-year period, the deputy minister asked all islanders to join hands in child protection, describing child abuse as a crosscutting problem. The questioner had wanted to know the rate of child abuse cases in the country for the past five years.
