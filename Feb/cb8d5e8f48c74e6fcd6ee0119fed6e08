Young Africans have landed safely in Mali ahead of their important match against De Bamako in CAF Confederation Cup on Sunday. It is going to be their first ever meeting in any competition a signal that the encounter is tough to either side. They meet in their third assignment of group D, searching a win to bag maximum points and stand a good chance to step into the quarterfinals. For Yanga, they have two Malian players who are first choice goalkeeper Djigui Diarra and center-back Mamadou Doumbia. Doumbia who joined the Jangwani side during the past mini-transfer window is yet to be featured for his new club so far. Nasreddine Nabi’s men go into the game heads up after picking maximum points following a deserved 3-1 win over TP Mazembe at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam last Sunday. The positive results gives them confidence to outshine their Malian opponents who are yet to win a confederation cup game. From two matches played, De Bamako have cherished one draw against US Monastir while in their opening game, they suffered a 3-1 defeat to TP Mazembe. As such, playing at home, they do not want to lose ground again hence the Sunday’s clash with Yanga will be exceptional.
