THE Minister for Culture, Arts, and Sports Pindi Chana has encouraged Simba players not to lose hope in their quest to excel in CAF Champions League saying they need to aim high. Her sentiments came following Simba’s 3-0 loss to Raja Casablanca in their second group C match of the Champions League at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam over the weekend. “Do not lose hope, there are many games coming up…today (Saturday), you played very well only that good results were not to your side. “I am here to encourage you, you have been representing well this country in international matches and other teams have not reached that status, keep it up and government will always be with you,” she said. On his part, Director of Information Services and Chief Government Spokesperson Gerson Msigwa said the pledge made by President Samia Suluhu Hassan to buy each scored goal for 5m/- is to make them play lungs out. “I know you have other game on February 25th against Vipers in Uganda and other matches will follow, the motive of the president to purchase goals will continue in upcoming encounters. “You fly high national flag and basing on the displayed performance, I am sure that you can easily overpower Vipers. Let’s go and defeat them to move on,” Msigwa said. He added that without doubt, Simba is a big club in the country and seized the platform to declare that he will personally be present at all Simba matches. Tomorrow, they host Azam in the 23rd round match of the Premier League at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in the city in a game dubbed Mzizima Derby.
