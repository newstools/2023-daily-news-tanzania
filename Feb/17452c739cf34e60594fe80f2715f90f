ARUSHA Regional Administrative Secretary Missaile Musa has directed district councils’ directors to identify Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which are yet to receive training from the Fair Competition Commission (FCC). The move, according to the regional administrative secretary will enable the SMEs produce quality products and eventually thrive in the competitive market. Opening a special training on control of counterfeit products here midweek, Mr Musa urged the SMEs to comply with FCC’s rules and guidelines. “SMEs need to be exposed to such sessions with a view of improving their way of doing business,” he observed. According to the Regional Administrative Secretary, the training will also help the SMEs to penetrate different markets and be competitive. “The target is to improve the value chain and support our SMEs so that they remain relevant,” he said. Mr Missaile also called on the district council directors to liaise with FCC in enhancing competition among SMEs in their areas as well as controlling counterfeits by inspecting quality of goods and products in the districts. Expounding on the training, FCC’s northern Zone Manager Nonge Juma said the session sought to enable the SMEs produce quality products in the market. The training, according to the FCC official also aimed to equip the SMEs to identify fake products that he said could hurt the economy. “Counterfeiters create serious problems for authentic businesses, but too many people are unaware of the full extent of the impact of counterfeit goods on brands,” said the FCC Northern Zone Manager. According to the Fair Competition Act, FCC is mandated with developing and promoting policies for enhancing competition and consumer welfare.
