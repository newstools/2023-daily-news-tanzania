ISLES First Lady, Maryam Mwinyi has launched another round of intensified Covid-19 vaccination that aims to reach one hundred per cent of the eligible population before the end of this year. Mama Maryam has cautioned the public that the threat of Covid-19 was still there therefore, everyone must be aware and take vaccination seriously. She informed the public through a televised advert that the vaccination initiated by her ‘Zanzibar Maisha Bora Foundation (ZMBF)’ targets Unguja West A District and Unguja North ‘A’ where the number of vaccinated people remains low. “ZMBF has decided to support the ongoing government initiatives to increase awareness and bring vaccination closer to the people. Covid-19 vaccination will be administered in all health centres in the targeted areas of West A, and North A districts,” Mama Maryam said. The first lady explained that the target was to vaccinate 47,123 people in Unguja North A by December last year, but only 16, 715 people were vaccinated, while in Unguja West A District, the target was to vaccinate 26, 641 people, but only 15,186 turned- out for the vaccine. She said that her NGO the ZMBF established in 2021 is committed to reach more people in the Islands of Unguja and Pemba during the one-year vaccination campaign, which started on 22 December last year. “We urge people from the age of 18 to voluntarily get vaccinated. The jab is safe and will protect us from Covid-19,” she said. Commenting on ZMBF’s new drive, the Minister of Health Mr Nassor Ahmed Mazrui said they welcome the plan because it will help reach more people.d
