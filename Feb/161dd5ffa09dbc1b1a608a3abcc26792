ZANZIBARIS were on Friday implored to embrace home made products to support the country’s small entrepreneurs, create jobs and accelerate national economic growth. Minister of State, President Office, Labour, Economy and Investment, Mr Mudrik Ramadhan Soraga told the House of Representatives that the 2022 national economic empowerment policy encourages consumption of domestic goods as well as promotion of the Made in Zanzibar brand. “We have both to join hands in mobilising wananchi to use domestic products,” Minister Soraga said in his response to Mwanakwerekwe Representative, Mr Ameir Abdalla Ameir, who had sought to know the government strategies to promote domestic products. The legislator commended the government efforts to uplift small entrepreneurs in the country but said more efforts are needed to inspire islanders to prefer domestic products over imports. The minister explained that the government, through media programmes, is mobilising wananchi to consume made in Zanzibar products but also challenged entrepreneurs to improve quality to compete with imports. “Marketing of entrepreneurs’ products is one of the government priorities and strategies are underway to expand the domestic and export markets,” said the minister, adding that the government is working on availability of packaging materials in the country to boost quality.
