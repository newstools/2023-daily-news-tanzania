SIMBA face Al Hilal in a buildup international friendly match at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam today. It is the last signal-testing encounter for Al Hilal before heading to South Africa to play Mamelodi Sundowns in their first group-stage match of CAF Champions League. This is the third friendly encounter for Al Hilal in the country as they have already played against Namungo and drew 1-1 before beating Azam 1-0, all matches staged at Azam Complex in the city. Their Head Coach Flourent Ibenge already said the three games will help him a lot to understand better his side before marching to the battlefield. They are packed in group B alongside Al Ahly (Egypt), Cotton Sport (Cameroon), and Mamelodi Sundowns (South Africa). For Simba, it is also a good weighing platform for their team ahead of the start of CAF Champions League’s group stage mission. Simba’s Head Coach Roberto Oliviera has on several occasions insisted that his target is to help Simba perform well in the Champions League. As such, playing against Al Hilal will add something positive to the team and facilitate the fighting spirit among his charges who have a reputation for doing well in international duties. Packed in group C, Simba will have to get the better of Raja Casablanca of Morocco, Horoya of Guinea, and Vipers from Uganda in order to go above the group stage line.
