Tout Puissant Mazembe alias ‘TP Mazembe’ have forecasted a tough match against Young Africans at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam on Sunday. The duo meets in their group D second match of CAF Confederation Cup (CAF-CC) with each side salivating for maximum points. In his brief remarks after landing in the city on Thursday night, TP Mazembe’s holding midfielder Mukoko Tonombe admitted that the game is tense. “This is probably the most difficult match in our group but we are fully prepared to produce meaningful results. “I know Yanga very well, they have good players like Fiston Mayele and many others with quality to have an impact as the encounter unfold,” says the former Yanga player. However, for the hosting side, it is a must win duel in order to rekindle hopes of reaching into the quarterfinals. The Jangwani street side have since claimed that all their necessary arsenals will be at disposal to clear Mazembe’s hurdle.
