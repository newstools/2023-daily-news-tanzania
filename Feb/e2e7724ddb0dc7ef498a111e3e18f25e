The death toll from the Turkey-Syria earthquakes has crossed 41,000. Turkish authorities say 35,418 people have been killed in the country. The Syrian government and the UN say more than 5,800 people died in Syria. Aid has begun trickling into northwestern Syria, nine days after the quakes, with a UN convoy carrying humanitarian assistance passing through the Bab al-Salam crossing from Turkey. The WHO is describing the earthquakes in Turkey as the worst natural disaster in a century in what it characterises as its Europe region. The UN is appealing for $397m in aid to help five million Syrian survivors with shelter, healthcare and food.
