When we begin with mutual respect and mutual interests, that’s how we get to mutual prosperity…we ALL benefit. Kazi iendelee and let’s get it done!,” the envoy tweeted. After presenting his documents in Dodoma, the US Ambassador said in his tweet: “It was an honor to meet President @SuluhuSamia and present my credentials as the new US Ambassador to Tanzania. “Looking forward to getting down working on strengthening the great partnership between our nations that has grown over 60 years and hopefully taking it to new levels.” The United States established diplomatic relations with Tanzania (then-Tanganyika) in 1961.
