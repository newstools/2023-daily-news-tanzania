THE Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT) in collaboration with Morogoro and Gairo District authorities has embarked on a project aimed at growing tree seedlings for environment protection. SAGCOT Manager for Kilombero District, Mr John Nakei, said the project has been initiated following the extreme destruction of the environment in various areas in the Morogoro region. “In August last year, SAGCOT partners in collaboration with the government in Morogoro and Gairo Districts through the Kilombero Green Reference Group (GRG) platform decided to start this project involving the private sector, with the aim of preventing environment from climate change effects in future,” said Mr Nakei. He said in the implementation of the resolutions made during the forum, a total of 500,000 seedlings have already been planted in Gairo District where most of the seedlings are for fruit trees such as mangoes, papayas and oranges while in Morogoro, a small project for growing 17,000 clove and mango seedlings has started. “These clove trees are grown along the Mbozi, Mbezi and the Mfizigo River, all these rivers are the source of water flowing to Ruvu River, but also it is very important to farmers and residents of Coast and Dar es Salaam regions,” he said. According to Mr Nakei, the project is expected to benefit the residents of five wards in taking care of the soil that is deteriorating and contaminating the water relied by many stakeholders in the lower belt. “The availability of the seedlings has been funded by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and implemented by the Holy Green Agro Company in Morogoro under the supervision of the Morogoro District Commissioner’s Office,” he said. Mr Nakei said the planting of the seedlings will give a lesson to people on alternative crops that could be cultivated along the rivers and how to preserve soil to reduce the erosion. He said the SAGCOT and its partners are calling on various stakeholders to come up with such innovation to support the Government’s efforts in fighting climate change effects.
