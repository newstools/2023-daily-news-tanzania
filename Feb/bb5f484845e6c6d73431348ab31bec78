IN support of the government’s efforts to improve education and raise the next generation that will help the nation achieve its economic and developmental goals, Geita Gold Mining Limited (GGML) has built and handed over two classrooms to Kiziba Primary School located at Mwenegeza Village in Geita district, Geita Region. The two classes, worth Shs 42 million, aim to help provide a good learning environment for students whose performance is affected by a difficult learning environment. Speaking at the handover ceremony at the end of the week in Geita on behalf of the General Director of GGML, Terry Strong, the company’s Relations Officer, Dorine Denis said that education is an important pillar of society, so without it, there can be no advancement, “education can change people’s lives and is a focus for our community investment projects.” She said Geita Gold Mining Limited believes that the people of Tanzania are the company’s greatest asset and has always supported the government’s efforts to improve education and nurture the future generation that will help the nation of Tanzania achieve its ambitious economic and development goals. She added that GGML is committed to the sustainable development of the communities surrounding the mine and has consistently demonstrated that by actively working with the government to improve social services, including education, health, water and roads, as well as other economic activities for the communities surrounding the mine. “We intend to create a legacy to build a sustainable local economy that can outlast the mining activities in Geita,” Denis Said and add: “I am therefore especially pleased that the building of these classrooms is as a result of a collaborative effort between the government, the host community, and Geita Gold Mining Limited. She has promised to continue collaborating with the Tanzanian government and other stakeholders to achieve the mining sector’s goal of contributing 10% to Tanzania’s GDP by 2025. On other hand Kiziba Primary School Principal Beatus Mwandu thanked GGML for the construction of the classrooms, especially considering that the school is still facing a shortage of classrooms while others are dilapidated. In addition, Nyakagomba Ward Executive, Christopha Amos also thanked GGML for the support and promised to convey other challenges to the Director of Geita District Council so that he can work on them.
