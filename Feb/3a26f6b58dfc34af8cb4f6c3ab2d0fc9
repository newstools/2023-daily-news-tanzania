THE Zanzibar’s Second Vice-President Hemed Suleiman Abdulla has urged adults, in marriage to avoid divorces as it contributes to increasing number of street children. Mr Abdulla raised this issue when he engaged with local people and fellow Muslims in Jumbi village, Unguja South Region. “Let us protect our marriages by resolving our disputes amicably. Divorces have huge consequences on children. Most lose proper care and risk becoming criminals,” he said. Mr Abdulla observed that there has been an increase of street children or loitering children attributed to divorce due to lack of patience in marriage. He said in most cases divorce leads to the separation of the children and their parents. Mr Abdulla urged Muslims believers to uphold and follow the instructions contained in religious Holy Books as well as teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), so that people including children can uphold good values and behaviours. “I urge parents and guardians to ensure children are taught and nurtured well so that they become good citizens,” the Second Vice-President said as he emphasised using worship building to discuss and condemn moral decay and evil practices in the community. Mr Abdulla also urged the people of Zanzibar to maintain the existing peace in order to provide opportunities for the Government to bring development to its people. Meanwhile, on separate occasions, the Commissioner of Police (CP) – Zanzibar Hamad Khamis Hamad also held a public rally here and advocated proper upbringing of children for a peaceful nation. He said that the best way to control and minimize crime including Gender Based Violence (GBV), theft and corruption practices is by nurturing the children properly in a stable family.
