PRIME Minister Kassim Majaliwa has instructed the Arusha Regional Commissioner (RC) John Mongella to bring to justice an Arusha resident alleged to have molested his child. The Premier issued the directive as images of the Standard Two pupil narrating his ordeal continue being re-shared on social media platforms. The PM was categorical that the government will not turn a blind eye on such criminal incidents. Mr Majaliwa equally directed regional police commanders across the country to leave no stone unturned in flushing out perpetrators of such crimes and eventually bring them to book. According to the Prime Minister, the society was now treated to incidences of parents committing felony on their children, insisting that the government will not let perpetrators of such crimes walk scot-free. “Sexual abuse on children has become widespread across the country, some children’s have been psychologically affected while others have had their dreams cut short because of being molested and defiled, we will act tough on such culprits,” the PM vowed. He directed the regional police bosses to liaise with social welfare officers to squarely deal with such offenders and ensure that they pay for their actions. Mr Majaliwa also appealed to members of the public to denounce such acts and cooperate with law enforcers in exposing such ills. Meanwhile, Arusha Regional Commissioner John Mongella said the culprit has since been arrested by the police. According to the regional commissioner, the victim has also been admitted at Mt Meru Regional Referral Hospital for further treatment.
