Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to arrive in the UK today, in his first visit since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year. According to BBC, while in UK, Zelensky would meet British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and make a speech in Parliament thereafter. It has also announced that British training of Ukrainian forces will be expanded to cover fighter jet pilots and marines. It’s also expected the UK will announce fresh sanctions targeting Russia later. Plans have been announced to train Ukrainian pilots to fly Nato-standard fighter jets in the future, a key request from Ukraine.
