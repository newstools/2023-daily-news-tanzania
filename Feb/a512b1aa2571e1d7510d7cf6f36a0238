THE National Sports Council has urged sports stakeholders in the country to support sports associations to enable them motivate young people to engage more in the various fields of sports. The NSC Executive Secretary Neema Msitha made the call during the handover of sports kit to the Kabbadi team. The handover was held on Friday in Dar es Salaam. The Maajabu 18 organisation offered the kit worth 900,000 /- to the team as a major support to the team in their various local and global level events. Thirty-two jerseys were handed to the Kabaddi team and the remaining four were provided to the kabaddi leaders. Msitha said if the stakeholders show up and support the team, the sector will rise inside and outside the country. “I urge various stakeholders to show up and support various clubs and associations so that they can develop,’’ she urged. On his side, the Maajabu 18 Organisation Director Mussa Athumani said that the participation of the young people in sports will help reduce crime, so they decided to support the talents of young people so as to fulfill their dreams. ‘We have decided to hand over the jersey aiming to support the team because our goal is to empower the young people with sports talents including the ones who have engaged in the Kabaddi game,’’ said Athumani. Adding, the Kabaddi Sports Chairman Abdallah Nyoni said the owner of the organisation had provided the sports gear, firstly because he is most interested in the game and he is motivated by the contract signed by the team and St Joseph University. Moreover, he thanked the organisation for offering the jersey and said the items will be provided to the players and leaders of the team. He said that the sports kit will be used in various leagues including the one that expects to be held next month. Nyoni has also vowed to continue coordinating with other stakeholders in developing the sector as the game has to evolve quickly.
