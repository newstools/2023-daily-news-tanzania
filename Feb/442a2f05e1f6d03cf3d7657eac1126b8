Chief Government Spokesman Gerson Msigwa has said President Samia Suluhu Hassan’s promise to ‘buy each goal’ scored by Simba SC and Young Africans in CAF tournaments continues. Msigwa who doubles as Director of Information Services says the package amounting to 5m/- per each goal scored by the Dar es Salaam based clubs will be released until the end of the CAF competitions. Simba SC are in CAF Champions League’s Group C with top leaders Raja Casablanca, Horoya and Vipers. Young Africans alias Yanga qualified for CAF CC and was paired with TP Mazembe, US Monastir and De Bamako. Simba lost 3-0 to Tunisian Raja Casablanca in Dar es Salaam over the weekend and missed a chance to pocket the amount promised by the head of State. Their traditional rivals, Young Africans emerged beneficiaries of President’s promise after thrashing DRC’s TP Mazembe 3-1 in Dar es Salaam on Sunday evening and walked away with a total of 15m/-.
