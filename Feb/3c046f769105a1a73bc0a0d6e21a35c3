RESIDENTS of Mafia Island have been urged to plant more trees and preserve natural environment for a major objective of protecting living things both on land and in ocean. Mafia District Council Chairman, Mr Juma Salum, who is also the Councillor for Kilindoni Ward, made the call at the launching of the district’s trees planting campaign at Mlambani Primary School at Kilindoni Ward recently. The Island is one of the few places in the world which are blessed with natural tourist attractions, including hosting swaths of mangroves, urging residents to support the government’s initiatives in protecting them. “Our Island is the home to famous fish known as whale shark which is one of the largest fish in the world. The fish is feeding on planktons which are highly affected by increasing temperature. If we don’t take proper care of our environment, it is most likely that there will be rise in temperature which will result into disappearance of these plants, endangering existence of the whale sharks,” he said. Council’s Environment Officer, Mr Mtemi Kasuga said that about one million trees were expected to be planted in this year. For his part, Acting District Executive Director (DED), Mr Simon Lendita, said his office will ensure that all trees which will be planted this season grow well, saying next year assessment will be conducted to establish the number of trees that grew. “We want to stop this tendency of planting trees and neglecting them. This time we will do thorough follow up for better results,” he emphasised. District Commissioner Zephania Sumaye called upon all leaders in their respective areas to make environment assessment and start the exercise of planting trees without delay. “We can deal with climate change effects if we all join together and stop all actions which are dangerous to our environment. Let us all aim at making our island one of the best places in the world with the natural beauty for generations to come.”
