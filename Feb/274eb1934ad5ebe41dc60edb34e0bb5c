Young Africans have established an 8-point gap at the top of the Premier League table courtesy of a 1-0 win over KMC. The two teams have settled their differences at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam on Wednesday afternoon. A 38th minute strike by Clement Mzize takes his side to 62 points from 23 matches as they continue to chase the seasonâ€™s title. With the victory, the Jangwani street giants sit eight points clear above their closest championship chasers Simba who have 54 points after 23 outings. For KMC, it is their tenth defeat of the campaign and remain glued to 12th place on the log with 23 points. The Kinondoni based side are not completely safe as far as relegation battle is concerned hence they need to wake up in their upcoming fixtures.
