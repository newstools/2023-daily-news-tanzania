THE government has called on sports stakeholders to continue organising many youth competitions as one way to produce talented athletes. Deputy Minister for Culture, Arts and Sports Pauline Gekul made the call yesterday at the ongoing parliament deliberations in Dodoma. To ensure its success, Gekul said over 2bn/- has been approved by the parliament to facilitate the construction of 56 sports academies in the exercise and she said upon completion, many benefits will be recorded. “The government is serious in making sure that more talented youths are produced in competitions which are conducted. “Also, the Inter-primary school games do help a lot in identifying youth talents and we, as government, are obliged to create a friendly environment for them to enjoy the games,” she said. Adding, she said the exercise to construct 56 sports centres across the country has begun and that it will help a lot to sharpen the skills of young people who later become representatives of the country in international events. “In all regions, we will have at least two academies whose primary purpose is to improve talent of young athletes because we believe that out there, people have potential but they lack platforms to display them,” she said. Furthermore, Gekul revealed that over 2bn/- was approved by the parliament to facilitate the exercise.
