DCB Commercial Bank has pledged to come up with innovative banking products and solutions that aim at boosting financial inclusion by reaching the financially underserved population in the country. The DCB Commercial Bank Acting Managing Director, Mr Isidori Msaki, made the remarks after his bank received recognition from the Tanzania Bankers Association (TBA) for its contribution and supporting in building resilient financial sector in the country. “The TBA recognition of our contribution to building strong financial sector, is for us motivation and incentive to work hard by innovating new banking products and solutions that suit the financially underserved population,” he said. The event to recognise banks’ contribution in building a robust financial sector went alongside with seeing off the former Bank of Tanzania (BoT) Governor, Professor Florens Luoga and welcoming the new Governor, Mr Emmanuel Tutuba. “DCB bank will continue to uplift the quality of its services and also add options to expand products portfolio that meet the needs of our customers,” he said during the event held in Dar es Salaam recently. “I take this opportunity to call upon Tanzanians to use our products which are superior and assure them that they will be satisfied with the value for money,” he said. Mr Msaki thanked TBA for recognising the contribution of the bank, adding that they regarded the award as a debt repayable by DCB to continue play the role of coming up with relevant solutions that offer better banking services that augur with needs of customers. The award punctuated DCB’s existing history of being recognised for its contribution towards delivery of better services and for the bank’s support for growth of the banking sector. Last year, DCB scooped the award for delivery of better banking services to customers and also bagged the award for better presented financial reports in the mid-sized bank docket issued by the National Board of Accountants and Auditors (NBAA).
