Young Africans have been presented with a 5m/- cash prize from President Samia Suluhu Hassan. The amount is the Presidentâ€™s pledge of buying each goal to be scored by Simba and Yanga in CAF Interclub Games. Yanga secured a 1-1 draw against Real De Bamako in the confederation cup group D match played in Mali last Sunday hence qualifying for the 5m/- prize. The team has since landed back safely from Mali on Tuesday afternoon through Julius Nyerere International Airport (JNIA) in Dar es Salaam. Handling the amount to Yanga President Hersi Said at the airport was the Director of Information Services and Chief Government Spokesperson Gerson Msigwa.
