Former Tanzania’s President Jakaya Kikwete has said “a positive HIV diagnosis is no longer a death sentence”, thanks to the US government and Congress for supporting the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Using his verified Twitter handle @jmkikwete, President Kikwete thanked former US President George W. Bush for inviting him to Washington to take part in the 20th PEPFAR 20th anniversary. “Congratulations for being compassionate. Millions of lives have been saved. Today, a positive HIV diagnosis is no longer a death sentence. Thanks to the US Gov’t and Congress for supporting @PEPFAR,” Dr Kikwete tweeted. The retired President, Kikwete on Friday participated in the REPFAR 20TH anniversary that was held at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington, US. The event, organised by the George W. Bush Institute, focused on the inception of PEPFAR, its enormous impact and how the program is a win for both partner countries and for U.S. Foreign policy. Apart from Kikwete, other famous leaders who joined President George W. Bush in the event are Dr Condoleezza Rice, Bill Gates and Mrs George W. Bush. PEPFAR is a part of the Bush Institute’s body of work advocating for continued support of PEPFAR’s mission and U.S engagement in global health. The U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is being led, managed and overseen by the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and Global Health Diplomacy. Through PEPFAR, the U.S. government has invested over $100 billion in the global HIV/AIDS response, the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in history, saving 25 million lives, preventing millions of HIV infections, and accelerating progress toward controlling the global HIV/AIDS pandemic in more than 50 countries.
