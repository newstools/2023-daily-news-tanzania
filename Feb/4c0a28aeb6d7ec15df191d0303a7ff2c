ECOBANK Group, the leading Pan-African bank, has won the Best Place to Work in Africa 2022 Award from the Best Place to Work organisation. The Award honours organisations that exhibit the highest standards of excellence in Human Resources (HR) practices and employees experience. Mr Ecobank is the first Pan-African bank to have been awarded the certification. Ade Ayeyemi, the Chief Executive Officer, Ecobank Group, said they recognise that workers are their greatest asset. “As a pan-African bank, we are intentional in deploying resources to attract, develop and retain the right talent,” Mr Ayeyemi, said yesterday in a release. He noted that receiving international recognition as being one of the Best Places to Work in Africa was a great honour. The certification programme involves rigorous assessment and rankings based on the results of robust and objective assessments carried out at various hierarchical levels and across HR operations and procedures. The areas covered include HR practices, compensation, benefits, leadership, teamwork, employee engagement and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Yves Mayilamene, the Group Executive, Human Resources at Ecobank, said: “We support and empower our talent to excel in an enabling and conducive working environment while investing in their growth and wellbeing.” The certification of the Best Place to Work accreditation is for one year (November 2022-November 2023). In Africa, there were 29 Best Places to Work organisations recognised in 2022. These include Alsa, eHealth Africa, Hilti, IHS, Ooredoo and Pharma 5. Some global companies with operations in Africa – such as AstraZeneca, Dell, Nestlé and Roche – were also among the winners.
