The Government is planning to deploy systems to combat nude images as a step towards making the internet a safer place. Speaking in the Parliament in Dodoma on Friday, Minister for Information, Communication and Information Technology, Nape Nnauye said the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) has come up with a special plan that will control such images and also track those circulating them. “Through TCRA, we have increased investment and now we are in the final stages of increasing the ability to control the movement of such images by setting up gate ways. Once this investment is completed and the installation of this system is completed, we will have controlled it to a large extent,” Mr Nape told Parliamentarians. The Minister was responding to a question from Kinondoni MP Abbas Tarimba who sought to know the government’s plans to combat immoral images. Elaborating, Mr Nape said one of the challenges they face in ICT is how to control the images. He, however, assured the lawmakers that of now, Tanzania is capable of tracing the nude images or video clips. “Let me warn those who receive such pictures, the easiest way is if you receive such a picture do not share it to another person, better delete it because if you send it to someone, the authorities have the ability to know who sent them and recipients,” he warned.
