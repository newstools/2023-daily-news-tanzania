President Samia Suluhu Hassan has witnessed the signing of 26 contracts worth 1.9tri/- for implementation of National Grid Stabilization and Rural Energy Agency (REA) projects. The signing of contracts marks the beginning of implementation of 4.42tri/- projects aiming at boosting Tanzania’s energy sector in the period of four years. A total of 500bn/- has already been released for power stabilization projects. Out of the said amount, according to President Samia, the government released 400bn/- while 100bn/- others contributed to the IMF. Speaking after the signing of the deals at the State House in Dar es Salaam on Tuesday, the Head of State directed the contractors to discharge their duties diligently. She, equally, advised government officials and authorities not to fall in the traps and bureaucratic chains that would lead to the delay of such projects. “Do not drag us backward on the basis of, ‘the law says this or allows this’ I believe that those who sat in the tender were careful and if they took bribes and it happens that the contractor made blunders, I will deal with them,” the Head of State insisted. The Head of State further instructed the Public Service Recruitment Secretariat to allow organizations that are capable of paying salaries to workers without depending on the government confer to do so in order to avoid delays of the projects. “But also, I want to tell you that, if you see that there is any person who is not working at the pace you desire, change that person. Do not allow anybody to drag you behind. If I am the one to make the changes, just inform me but if it is in your discretionary power, change the person,” she said.
