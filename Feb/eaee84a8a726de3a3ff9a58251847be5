THE Tanzania Premier League Board (TPLB) said installation of floodlights at Mkwakwani Stadium in Tanga will enhance live beaming of all league matches at the venue. This gives an opportunity for Tanga residents to experience some night games played in the city a thing they used to see that in other venues. However, in his remarks, the board’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Almasi Kasongo hailed the development saying it has come at the right time. “Let me thank Azam for facilitating the installation of floodlights system in various because it will help them to fulfill contractual obligations of broadcasting live all league games,” he said. Mkwakwani Stadium has since joined Namungo Stadium in Lindi, Jamhuri Stadium in Dodoma and Kaitaba Stadium in Kagera as four arenas outside Dar es Salaam capable to host night matches. Overall, the country now has six venues fitted with floodlights ready to accommodate night football encounters plus Azam Complex and Benjamin Mkapa Stadium both in the city. However, the other advantage of night duels is that more people are likely to attend as they have completed their daily chores unlike with afternoon fixtures. In a nutshell, this is one of the indicators signaling the massive investment being diverted for infrastructure improvement bearing in mind that not many football leagues on the continent embrace night schedules.
