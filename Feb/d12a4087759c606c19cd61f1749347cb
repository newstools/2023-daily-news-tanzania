Tanzanian top pujilist Tony Rashid has claimed the ABU Super Bantom Weight title after outclassing Sabelo Ngebinyana on points. The 12-round bout eclipsed a chain of other fights held at Ubungo Plaza in Dar es Salaam on Friday night. This was the main event bout after the cancellation of ABU Super Middleweight clash between Selemani Kidunda against Patrick Makala of DR Congo. With the victory, Rashid who is currently the highest ranking boxer in the country has excelled to clinch the championship for the third time. In his brief remarks, he dedicated the title to president Samia Suluhu Hassan while admitting that his opponent gave him a good showdown. “As a champion, I face champions…Sabelo is a champion in South Africa but I have succeeded to defeat him. “I continue to learn many things from skilled boxers of his (Sabelo) caliber,” says him. His South African counterpart says being a champion does not necessarily mean to win a title but rather no matter what happens, you keep on going.
