LINDI Regional Commissioner Ms Zainabu Taleck has directed health officers in the region to ensure regular provision of nutrition education and counselling to pregnant women to improve their nutritional status during pregnancy. Ms Telack said nutritional needs during pregnancy are crucial for a baby’s growth throughout pregnancy. It also has a great effect in reducing the risk of anaemia and increasing weight for the baby. She made the call recently when officiating at a meeting on nutrition assessment organised at the regional level in Lindi. She insisted on the need for the nutrition officers in the region to ensure the nutritional education is widely conducted in the region to reach each and every pregnant woman and those women who are breastfeeding. The RC urged mothers’ breastfeeding to ensure they fulfill nutritional needs to prevent childhood malnutrition. Regional Medical Officer Dr Khery Kagya said Lindi Region in collaboration with stakeholders is currently implementing various interventions and nutrition programmes towards preventing stunting in the region. He said the national nutrition survey indicates that stunting has reduced from 23.8 per cent in 2018/2019 to 21.3 in 2020/2021. He said the statistics rate the region as number four among regions that perform better in the fight against stunting. Dr Kagya said the government in the region is currently implementing various interventions to get rid of stunted growth in the region. Regional Nutrition Officer in Lindi Ms Juliana Chikoti said stunting in children is mainly caused by poor breastfeeding. During the meeting, the stakeholders in collaboration with the government in the region put across strategic plans aimed at improving nutrition in the region.
