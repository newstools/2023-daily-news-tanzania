THE motorcycle riders, commonly named ‘bodaboda’ in Geita region have admitted that campaigns against Gender-Based Violence (GBV) through sport competitions have lured them to participate in the crusades. The competition is organised to encourage youth engagement in campaigns against Gender Based Violence (GBV). The competition is part of the Project called ‘Keeping Adolescent Girls in School (KAGIS)’ which is implemented by Plan International in collaboration with Rafiki Development Organisation (RAFIKI SDO). Speaking over the weekend in Geita town council at the match between bodaboda youths from Kasamwa Ward and Ihanamilo Ward, the coach of the Ihanamilo bodaboda team, Mr Kasoga Philipo, said the competition has pushed them to promote the KAGIS campaign. “We have paid a lot of time for the campaign with great enthusiasm, we are fighting and we will always fight against GBV, to make sure we lift the school girls to achieve their goals,” he said. Captain of the Bodaboda Team from Ihanamilo ward, Mr Said Khamism, admitted that the KAGIS competition has raised awareness among them towards the right steps on reporting the acts of violence. The coach of the bodaboda team from Kasamwa Ward, Mr Omar Juma, said through the KAGIS competitions, bodaboda being parents, guardians, relatives and neighbours of adolescent girls, now feel they are responsible to protect the school girls. According to the Project Manager from Rafiki SDO, Mr Eliud Mtalemwa the KAGIS sport competition involves 16 wards of the KAGIS project, 10 wards of them are from Geita region and six wards of Kigoma region. He said, each ward has provided a team of 30 bodaboda drivers, making a total of 480 bodaboda drivers from both Geita and Kigoma regions who benefit from anti-violence education through the competition.
