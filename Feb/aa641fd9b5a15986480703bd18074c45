Manchester United have claimed their 6th Carabao Cup title after defeating Newcastle United 2-0. The two teams met at Wembley Stadium on Sunday night with the Red Devils emerging winners in front of their thousands fans. A 33rd minute header by Casemiro and an own goal in the 39th minute by Sven Botman have seen a long term trophy drought at the club ending in fascinating style. Bruno Fernandez nearly made it 3-0 for United in the 93rd minute when his one to one opportunity with Newcastle keeper Loris Karius was punched to safety. It is a good start for Manchester United coach Erik ten Hang who seems to have brought in a winning remedy and his side are now flying without wings.
