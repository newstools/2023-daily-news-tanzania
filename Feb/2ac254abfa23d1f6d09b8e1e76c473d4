YOUNG Africans players believe that they have reserved enough energy to silence TP Mazembe whom they host at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam tomorrow. They are both playing their second group D match of CAF Confederation Cup making this a palatable encounter as both sides are keen to collect maximum points. It is rather a must-win game for Yanga in order to rekindle their hopes of marching into the quarterfinals of the competition after suffering an away 2-0 loss to US Monastir in their group opener. On the other hand, Mazembe are just searching for two results either a win or a draw to cement their stay at the summit of the table as they currently sit top with 3 points. “Frankly, this is a very important match to us because we are playing at home and so far, almost all the teams in this contest who launched their campaign on home soil have either won or salvaged a point. “We are responding well to training sessions and morale among ourselves is great to the extent that we are just looking forward to the match day,” said Yanga’s centre-back Dickson Job yesterday. Adding, the team’s lethal striker Fiston Mayele pledged that he is going to double his work rate on the day for the sake of helping his team attain essential three points from the home turf. “I will be a different person from the one you have lately seen, our focus is to help the team win the game,” said Mayele who seized the platform to invite more Yanga fans at the stadium. However, TP Mazembe holding midfielder Mukoko Tonombe, speaking upon arrival at Julius Nyerere International Airport (JNIA) on Thursday night, predicted a tough match. “I am happy to be here once again and play against my former team. It is a difficult game but we are ready to play our part and make sure that we go back home with convincing results,” he said. After Sunday’s fixture, Yanga turn their focus to the premier league taking on KMC at the same venue on Tuesday before travelling to Mali to face De Bamako.
