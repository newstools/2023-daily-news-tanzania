THE Warehouse Receipt Regulatory Board (WHRRB) has accomplished its process for establishment of electronic warehouse (E-warehouse) that is expected to be launched next month. According to the WHRRB Executive Director, Mr Asangye Bangu, the new licences for warehouses will now be provided electronically in efforts to reduce inconveniences to the board’s clients. He was outlining key achievements so far attained by the board since its inception in 2006. The board became officially operational in 2007. He said his board was working on partnership with e-GA, a public entity dealing with putting up ICT systems in different ministries, departments, Local Government Authorities (LGAs) and public entities. In the new ICT system, Mr Bangu said all main warehouses in the country would be installed with CCTV cameras that will help the board monitor all activities inside and outside warehouses. According to the executive director, since it kicked off its operations, the board has so far formalised about 2.3 billion kilogrammes of 11 cash crops in warehouse system. Mr Bangu further said that his organisation was now mulling to incorporate into the warehouse receipt system other products apart from cash crops. To begin with, he said, the board had already made fruitful negotiations with the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries to put skin and hide products in the warehouse receipt system. “I am glad that the ministry has accorded us a very good support and already it has put in place digital measuring equipment for hides and skins,” he noted.
