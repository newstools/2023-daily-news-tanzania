INFLATED charges in procuring building materials, violation of procurement procedures and delayed completion of the projects are among shortfalls uncovered by the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) in Kagera Region, while investigating 54 projects worth 13.768bn/- on value for money. Deputy PCCB Kagera Regional Chief, Mr Ezekia Sinkala explained that the projects covered various sectors, including health, infrastructure, education, water and administration. “Between October 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022, PCCB investigated a total of 54 projects worth 13.768bn/- on the value for money. Initial investigations revealed that there were inflated charges in procuring building materials, violation of procurement procedures and delayed completion of the projects,” he said. The projects included construction of an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at the Bukoba Regional Referral Hospital, construction of a maternal ward at Kashai Ward, construction of a dispensary at Bisibo (Biharamulo) and rehabilitation of Nyakahura Health Centre. Mr Sinkala explained that during the period, PCCB recorded about 90 complaints, out of which 65 complaints did not relate to corruption. Out of the 25 cases related on corruption, the investigation on 11 cases had already been completed, while 14 cases were still under investigation. Elaborating, he said investigations revealed that some business people did not possess business licences and did not pay the necessary taxes. Also, some of the Ward Executive Officers (WEOs) allocated in councils violated regulations on revenue collection, causing loss on government revenue.
