The two-day session that began on the 9th- 10th of February and oganized by LSF will review proposals, work plans, as well as ZMOs budgets for the purpose of cross checking if the implementation of legal services is relevant to their various planned activities. Speaking during the opening of the working session in Dar es Salaam, the LSF Program Manager, Lawyer Deogratias Bwire, said their goal is to build understanding among the executives of the ZMOs to be an example in legal service delivery according to LSF five-year strategic plan guidelines and national development plan. “We want to meet the needs of changes in the implementation system of our programme for access to justice in the country, especially in the provision of subsidies,” the manager said. He added that initially, LSF had a system of providing grants to legal assistant organizations through Regional Mentors Organizations(RMOs) and later on decided to provide through direct funding modality, saying: “We have now decided to have regional management so as to increase efficiency.” On his side the LSF Monitoring and Result Manager; Said Chitung said their expectation is to get bigger results at the end of the programme as agreed in the two-day meeting.
