Driver’s Negligence and failure to adhere to road signs have been identified as the main causes of a Wednesday’s accident that occurred at Kisutu, Dar es Salaam where several people were injured. A Dar es Salaam Special Zone Police report issued Thursday had it that a driver of a mini multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) crossed into BRT corridor carelessly, a situation that forced a rapid bus ‘mwendokasi’ to deviate to minimize damages. Subsequently, the ‘Mwendokasi’ bus crashed into several shops along the BRT corridor and injured several pedestrians. “Initial investigation shows that the cause of the accident was due to the carelessness of the Toyota Avanza driver coming from one Mnazi to the DTV roundabout without taking necessary precautions when crossing the BRT corridor,” says Dar es Salaam Special Zone Police Commander, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Jumanne Muliro. The Police Force report says some still four people injured in the accidents are receiving treatment at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) IN Dar es Salaam. The Dar es Salaam Police boss named other survivors as Jumbe Mohammed (38), Shukuru Omari, Saidi Hasani and a pedestrian, Ismail.
