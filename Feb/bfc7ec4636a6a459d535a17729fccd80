Simba squad of 24-players left Dar es Salaam on Thursday afternoon for Kampala, Uganda eager to clear Vipers on Saturday. The two teams meet in CAF Champions League group C match at St Mary’s Stadium in a tense encounter. Both teams are yet to taste victory in the competition after going through win-less run in their two opening assignments. For the Reds, they desperately need a triumph to rekindle their hopes of stepping into the last 16 and a win on Saturday will drive them back on the right track.
