Key benchmark indices Sector Indices Debt Market Primary market The recent 10-year Treasury bond auction held on February 1, 2023 by the central bank saw a total amount of 133bn/- offered and a total tendered by investors of 74.958bn/-. The central bank accepted 64.456bn/-, with a weighted average yield to maturity increasing by 28 basis points to 11.0548 per cent. Despite the auction receiving a low subscription rate of 56.3 per cent, the higher yield reflects the central bank’s tight monetary policy, which is causing yields to climb higher. Furthermore this indicates that the demand for medium-tenured bonds is lower, leading to higher yields to attract investors. The yield curve, which represents the relationship between yields and maturity, is expected to steepen as a result. However, it is important to note that the increase in yields should be viewed optimistically, as it suggests that the economy is strengthening, leading to higher borrowing costs for the government. In conclusion, the recent 10-year Treasury bond auction highlights the central bank’s efforts to maintain a stable economy, with the increase in yields reflecting the strength of the economy. This will lead to a steepening of the yield curve, which should be viewed positively, as it signals growth and investment opportunities. Secondary market Trading activities increased for the week ending February 3, overall turnover for the week increased by 47.86 per cent from 61.31bn/- registered in the previous week to 90.6543bn/-. The number of trades decreased from 55 trades recorded in the previous trading week to 39 trades. Overall tenures traded were predominately on the long end of the yield curve, with the 20 year accounting for 86.59 per cent of the traded volumes.

Fixed income market The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held its meeting on 30th January 2023, in its statement, the MPC announced its decision to maintain a less accommodative monetary policy stance in January and February 2023. The main objective of this stance is to control inflationary pressures and promote sustainable growth of economic activities. The announcement of a less accommodative monetary policy stance is expected to result in a trend of upward movement in Treasury yields. This, in turn, is likely to have a slight negative short term impact on current bondholders. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions, so as yields increase, prices will decrease, providing current bond holders with capital losses. Additionally, a rise in yields can attract new investors to the bond market looking to capitalize by acquiring bonds on the cheap. While the shift in monetary policy may cause some uncertainty in the short term, it is important to note that a rise in yields is a reflection of a strong and stable economy.
