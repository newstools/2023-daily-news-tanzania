The president made the announcement on Tuesday through The Director of Information Services and Chief Government Spokesperson Gerson Msigwa. Simba host Raja Casablanca in a stand-up CAF Champions’ League group C encounter at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam on Saturday. Also, Yanga welcome TP Mazembe at the same arena on Sunday in group D CAF Confederation Cup match eyeing to retain maximum points from the home venue. In his reaction, Simba’s Media and Communication Manager Ahmed Ally said the pledge has come timely and will undergo thorough preparations in order to win with a big goal margin against Raja Casablanca. “As Simba, we are excited about this good news from our president and we have taken her words as an order…we promise to score many goals on the day to make her proud. “Even Simba players are thrilled with what president Samia has said. Aside from motivating players, it means she also follows the game of football and the only way to pay her back is to beat our opponent with many goals,” Ally said. In retrospect, Yanga’s centre-back Dickson Job also reiterated that they have been motivated with president Samia’s pledge and will work hard on the day to emerge winners. “The fact that this comes from the president is a big boost for us and on behalf of fellow teammates, I promise to never let her down on the day,” he said. Both Simba and Yanga launched group stage campaigns on back pedal after losing their away opening fixtures to Horoya (1-0) and US Monastir (2-0) respectively. However, both fixtures are tough and requires the country’s envoys to fully be prepared and instill winning confidence to players who are the ones responsible in carrying the big load on the pitch for 90 minutes.
