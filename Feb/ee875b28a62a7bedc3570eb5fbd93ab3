AZAM and Singida Big Stars are the two giants that  log to have suffered defeats in their 22nd Premier League assignments apiece. The two are since tied to 43 points after 22 outings and each has cherished 13 wins, four draws and five defeats. Azam lost 2-1 to Dodoma Jiji at Jamhuri Stadium in Dodoma over the weekend as the hosts picked their first ever triumph against the Ice Cream makers in competitive fixtures. The visitors were reduced to 10-men shortly before half-time when Senegal import Malickou Ndoye was shown marching orders for a reckless foul on Dodoma Jiji player. This made the Chamazi-based giants to endure the tricky encounter with 10 men, a situation which was positively utilised by the hosts to seize full command throughout the hot duel. Following their losses, both Azam and Singida Big Stars are 10-points inferior to the second- placed Simba and 16 points behind leaders Young Africans with eight matches to go before the season ends. Already, the Singida based side’s Head Coach Hans Van Pluijm has declared that their target is to finish the campaign on top four, a position that gives them an opportunity to play in CAF Interclub clashes. He made the remarks after losing 3-1 to Simba at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in the city on Friday. They, however, have an opportunity to claim their first title if they succeed to win the Azam Sports Federation Cup (ASFC) where they are still key contenders. Narrowly, Pluijm’s charges missed a chance to claim Mapinduzi Cup silverware after losing 2-1 to Mlandege in the epic final last month.
