SINGIDA Big stars Head Coach Hans Pluijm said their utmost goal in the ongoing Premier League is to finish among the top three teams. Speaking in an exclusive interview yesterday, Pluijm said the quality of his team gives him hope of finishing the season in the top three positions. Pluijm, the former Azam and Yanga gaffer, said that their strategy is to ensure they win all their remaining matches in order to achieve their team’s desired goal. “I’m not talking about becoming the champions because there is a big difference in points between us and Yanga, but we have the ability to fight with the teams of Azam FC and Simba calibre, that is why we are making sure we finish in those two positions behind the leaders,” he said. He said they have used a two-week break from the Premier League to strengthen his squad including correcting some of the shortcomings he saw in previous matches, including the one against Simba in which they lost 3-1. He said despite the existing competition, with the quality of the team he has, he does not see a reason not to claim one of the top positions when even his players have shown their willingness to fight for the team to finish the season in the top three. Singida Big stars are placed fourth after gathering 44 points from 23-game  outings. They have won thirteen, drawn five, and lost five matches. Singida Big Stars have netted 26 and conceded 19 goals. Singida United are scheduled to play Mtibwa Sugar at Liti Stadium in Singida today. On March 12th, they will play against Coastal Union at Mkwakwani stadium in Tanga. On April 7th, they will play against relegation-threatened Police Tanzania at Liti stadium in Singida.
