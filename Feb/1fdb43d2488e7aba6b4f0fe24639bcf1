Tanzania’s giants Simba have rekindled their hopes to reach in the last eight of CAF Champions League after a 1-0 win against Vipers. The two teams met at St Mary’s Stadium in Kampala, Uganda on Saturday evening with Simba claiming the important away win. Center-back Henock Inonga slotted in from the close range in the 20th minute and his goal stood until the final whistle. He received a well-calculated heading pass from Moses Phiri who partnered with Kibu Denis for Simba’s offensive section before they were substituted in the second half. It is the first win for the country’s champions league envoys who prior to that succumbed to two defeats from Horoya and Raja Casablanca. Meanwhile, Roberto Oliveira’s side host Vipers at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam on Saturday. On the day, Simba will be trying to record their first home win of the unfolding group stage campaign to entice their fans. Apart from collecting maximum points in Kampala, Simba will pocket in 5m/- from President Samia Suluhu Hassan who promised to buy each goal scored by Tanzania’s envoys Simba and Young Africans in CAFCL and CAFCC group stages respectively.
