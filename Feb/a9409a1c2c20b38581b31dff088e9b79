President Samia Suluhu Hassan has asked all Christians to pray for the country and the rest of the world’s peace as they begin the season with Ash on Wednesday.
Through her official twitter handle @SuluhuSamia, President Samia reminds Christians of the mortality, penance and the loving mercy of God. “I wish a prayerful and peaceful Lent to all Christians. As you mark the beginning of this season with Ash Wednesday today, may it be a reminder of our mortality, penance and the loving mercy of God. Let’s continue praying for our country, for peace and for a just world for all,” reads her tweet.
Ash Wednesday (February 22nd) is the official beginning of Lent. On this day of penitence, ashes are placed on people’s foreheads to represent their mortality.
They are placed in the sign of the cross as a reminder that “as Christians, we die in Christ and are saved by His amazing grace.” Ash Wednesday is one of the most popular and important holy days in the liturgical calendar. Ash Wednesday opens Lent, a season of fasting.
