YOUNG Africans are hopeful to stamp the first away win as they face AS Bamako in the group stage of the CAF Confederation Cup at Stade du 26 Mars in Mali today. The two teams play their third group D fixture in a seemingly tough match with both keen to grab maximum points and widen the chance to play in the last eight stage. AS Bamako, who sit at the base of the group with one point, are the only side in their category yet to stamp a victory as such; they are likely to defy the odds by playing lungs out. It is their second successive home match after securing a 1-1 draw with US Monastir meaning that a triumph guarantees them 4 points in the bag. On the other hand, the visitors are looking to generate a second back-to-back success after capsizing TP Mazembe 3-1 at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam last Sunday. If they win, they will claim 6 points in three fixtures which without a doubt will be a convincing run for them in their quest to go beyond the group stages. “I think it will be a difficult match basing on the fact that they have just one point and will be trying to accumulate maximum points making the game tense. “For us, we are also here to seek three points as such, you can imagine that it is going to be a tough test to each side,” remarked Yanga’s striker Fiston Mayele, who is yet to score in the group stage. Again, Mayele pointed out that the presence of two Malian players; Mamadou Doumbia and goalkeeper Djigui Diarra, is an appropriate ingredient for them to do well. “They know our opponents very well in terms of tactical and how they play a thing which is of big advantage for us to shine, but, we are going to do our best to accomplish the mission,” he said. However, both Yanga and Bamako lost their group D inaugural away matches to US Monastir and TP Mazembe respectively. In Malian Premiere Division, Bamako sit in second place with 21 points from ten games after winning six encounters, drawing three matches, and losing one game.
