HEALTH Minister Ummy Mwalimu has commended partnership entered between the Dodoma-based Benjamin Mkapa Hospital (BMH) and Kuwait-based Children’s Heart Charity Association for organising medical camps for children with cardiovascular complications. Under the 3-year partnership, the Children’s Heart Charity Association will provide the 400-bed capacity hospital with medical consumables, dispatching its medics to the BMH annually for joint medical camps as well as capacity building to its cardiologists. Ms Mwalimu pointed out recently that the partnership would help children born with cardiovascular complications in the country. “I recognise the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed between the BMH and Children’s Heart Charity Association,” Ms Ummy told the management of BMH and Kuwait medics who paid a courtesy call on the minister. Tanzania’s Ambassador to Kuwait, Mr Said Mussa, said the partnership between BMH and Children’s Heart Charity Association was part of economic diplomacy, saying the BMH would tremendously benefit from the collaboration. “This shows their readiness because I just met them last November, but they entered into agreement with the BMH after two months,” said the envoy. On his part, Executive Director of the BMH, Dr Alphonce Chandika, expressed gratitude to the government for giving green light to the BMH to enter an agreement with the Children’s Heart Charity Association. “This collaboration will help our local cardiologists to build capacity in performing open heart surgeries,” said the Hospital’s Executive Director.
