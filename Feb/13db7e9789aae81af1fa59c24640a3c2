THE Premier League’s main sponsor NBC has reacted positively to the news that the country’s top-flight league is fifth in Africa and 39th in the world saying it is an encouraging development. Recently, the International Federation of Football History and Statistics (IFFHS) released the latest rankings of the best leagues in Africa and the entire world with the Tanzanian top-flight league among the top five. However, in his reaction, NBC’s Head of Communication Godwin Semunyo hailed all Tanzanians for making this possible while calling for more action to be made in order to scale up the ladders. “This is the continuation of what we believe that football is a good source of employment and through this industry, we can build a strong economy aside from embracing it as a form of entertainment,” he said. Moreover, Semunyo reiterated that they will continue to provide Premier League monthly awards to the best coach, player, and manager of the month so as to increase the level of competition. However, according to the IFFHS paraded rankings, Egypt occupies first place in Africa and 13th in the world while Algeria is second in Africa and 20th in the world. Morocco is ranked third on the continent and 24th in the universe, Sudan is fourth in Africa and 33rd in the world whereas Tanzania scoops fifth place in Africa and 39th in the world. South Africa is ranked sixth and 52nd in the universe, Angola seventh and 60th in the world, Tunisia eighth and 68 on the globe, Nigeria ninth and 77th in the universe and Zambia are tenth and 79th in the world. As such, Tanzania has dominated entire Southern Africa for having a strong league, a position that is positive for the betterment of the country’s football.
