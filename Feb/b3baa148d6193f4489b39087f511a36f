The government has allocated over 10bn/- to settle debts it owes Air Tanzania Company limited (ATCL) workers, Deputy Minister for Works and Transport, Atupele Mwakibete has said. Mwakibete told parliamentarians on Monday that the government is all set to clear the debt and has been putting in place mechanisms to prevent fresh debts. “The remaining contributions to the social fund will be paid in this financial year,” Mr Atupele said, while responding to a supplementary question from a special seat MP, Angelina Malembeka. The lawmaker wanted to know when ATCL pensioners will receive their benefits. ATCL generated over 4.86bn/- debts for not submitting employees’ contributions to the social security funds.
