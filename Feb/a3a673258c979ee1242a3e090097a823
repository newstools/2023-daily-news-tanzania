Simba Head Coach Roberto Oliveira has landed back in the country on Wednesday morning from Brazil. The Brazilian trainer departed immediately after their away 1-0-win match versus Dodoma Jiji at Jamhuri Stadium in Dodoma on January 22nd. His departure raised eyebrows among some football fraternity who questioned the reason behind it forcing the management to clear the air saying he had gone to attend to ‘family issues’. Through the club’s Media and Communication Manager Ahmed Ally, he revealed that the coach would be back on February 1st. Meanwhile, Simba go head-to-head against Singida Big Stars in a tense Premier League match at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam on Friday. It is Oliveira’s third league match in the country as he looks to maintain his 100 percent start by producing a third successive triumph. His first league assignment was a 3-2 victory over Mbeya City before punishing Dodoma Jiji 1-0.
