AN American online tutor and resident of Mbezi Beach in Dar es Salaam, charged with drug trafficking case has expressed his intention to write a plea bargaining request to the office of the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP). Brandon Summerlin (30) told the Kisutu Resident Magistrateâ€™s Court on Tuesday when his case was brought for preliminary hearing, that he would prefer the matter to be resolved out of court. Summerlin is accused of trafficking narcotic drugs, namely mescaline weighing 56.04 grammes on November 12 last year at the post office within the Ilala District of Dar es Salaam region. The preliminary hearing was before the Kisutu Senior Resident Magistrate, Huruma Shahidi, by State Attorney, Tumaini Maingu. As Maingu was reading the preliminary hearing, the accused raised the concern that he wanted to enter into an agreement with the government by requesting a plea bargain. However, Magistrate Shahidi told the accused to follow proper plea bargaining procedures because he appeared before the court with a letter in his hands, which he claimed to be a plea bargaining request letter. Maingu also told the accused that plea bargaining requests need to follow procedures and be reviewed to see if the accused qualifies for the procedure.
