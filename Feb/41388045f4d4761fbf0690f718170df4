Simba said they are ready to face the unknown ahead of their CAF Champions League duel against Horoya, a side they claim to have never played before. The two teams meet tomorrow in Conakry, Guinea in  a tense group stage’s opening match as both teams are upbeat to collect maximum points. A 24-member Simba squad arrived safely in Guinea on Thursday with enough confidence to open the chapter positively by not conceding defeat which if they succeed, it will be a good start for them. The Msimbazi Street Reds are the country’s solo envoys in the champions league and via Head Coach Roberto Oliveira, have already indicated that they want to do well in the contest by clinching the championship. After facing Horoya, Simba will host Raja Casablanca of Morocco at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam for their first home encounter of the competition. Speaking in the city before the flight, the team’s Assistant Coach Juma Mgunda anticipated a difficult away match while insisting that his men are fit for the match. “All precautions to play against a team we have never met before are being taken into consideration in order to generate positive results,” he said. In a separate interview, the club’s Media and Communication Manager Ahmed Ally disclosed that Saido Ntibazonkiza has not travelled due to injury. Those passed fit for the game are Aishi Manula, Beno Kakolanya, Ally Salum, Shomari Kapombe, Israel Mwenda, Gadiel Micheal, Mohamed Hussein, Henock Inonga, Joash Onyango, Erasto Nyoni, Kennedy Juma and Mohamed Quattara.
