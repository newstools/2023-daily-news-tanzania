Tanzania Prisons have named Abdallah Mohamed ‘Baresi’ as the team’s new Head Coach on a one-year deal. An official statement from the club on Wednesday afternoon says the management has strong belief in Baresi that he is going to deliver. Before joining the Mbeya region side, Baresi steered Mlandege to win the 2023 Mapinduzi Cup title following a 2-1 success over Singida Big Stars in a tense final match. He is not new in the Premier League as he previously coached JKT Tanzania before facing the relegation jaws. Baresi fills the empty space left by former coach Patrick Odhiambo whose contract at the club expired and was not renewed. On the league table, Tanzania Prisons are placed on 12th place with 21 points from 21 matches equivalent to one point in each game. They host Mtibwa Sugar at Sokoine Stadium in Mbeya on Friday in Baresi’s first home assignment.
