GEITA Gold Mining (GGM) has extended its internship programme to 50 graduates in this year in a bid to enhance employability in the country. GGM Managing Director, Mr Terry Strong said on Tuesday that the programme is supporting the government’s initiatives to enhance graduates’ employability in the country. “The internship programme is implemented for twelve months and this year GGM has offered internship to 50 graduates, 30 females and 20 males,” Mr Strong said, adding that the programme started on Tuesday. GGML is contributing towards skills development in the country by providing graduates with opportunities to gain work experience in various skills areas. Also, the programme provides a platform to unemployed graduates to gain meaningful work experience that will complement their studies and provide them with experience that could help them gain access to the labour market. Dr Kiva Mvungi, the Senior Manager for Health, Safety, Environment and Training at GGM, said the interns recruitment is free of charge and those seeking money are con artists. “Beware of con artists. GGM does not receive money in exchange for a job or any other opportunity,” Dr Mvungi said. GGM has been working closely with the local government authorities to support a number of community projects in the Geita through Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as well as National programmes.
