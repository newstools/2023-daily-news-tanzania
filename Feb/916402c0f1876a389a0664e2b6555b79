The Premier League has accused Manchester City of breaching its financial rules following an investigation. In 2020 City had a two-year ban from European club competitions overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), after Uefa had ruled that City committed “serious breaches” of Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations between 2012 and 2016.
